I1LOC00 "Where am I?"
I1SAR00 "Welcome back from the dead, Revenant."
I1LOC01 "Who are you people?"
I1LOC02 "Who am I?"
I1LOC03 "Why have you brought me here?"
I1SAR01 "I am Sardok, advisor to the warlord Tendrick."
I1TEN00 "I am Tendrick, you are in Misthaven on the island of Ahkuilon."
I1LOC04 "Ahkuilon?"
I1SAR02 "Try not to think too hard, your memory will return to you in time."
I1LOC05 "I can't remember my name."
I1SAR03 "Of course not, you are a Revenant."
I1SAR04 "We have chosen a new name for you."
I1SAR05 "You are Locke D'Averam, bonded servant of the house of Averam."
I1LOC06 "Locke?"
I1TEN01 "Sardok has convinced me that you have certain qualities that will allow you to serve me in a very special way."
I1LOC07 "Serve you?"
I1TEN02 "Yes. A few years ago the followers of a strange new religion began to travel too our small island."
I1TEN03 "They called themselves, the Children of the Change, and at first they seemed harmless."
I1TEN04 "Recently however, they have begun raiding the town, coming secretly, taking people from their homes and disappearing into the night."
I1SAR06 "It soon became clear to us that the priests were taking our people and using them to increase their ranks."
I1TEN05 "All our soldiers, guards, and defenses proved useless against the mystic powers wielded by the priests."
I1TEN06 "With no way to defend ourselves, my people are forced to lock their doors and hope the priests pass them by."
I1TEN07 "But this is not the worst of it."
I1TEN08 "The priests stolen my only child, Andria, and this is why I have made the sacrifices necessary to call one such as yourself."
I1LOC08 "What does all this have to do with me?"
I1SAR07 "My summoning was very specific, and the price Tendrick paid for it was quite dear."
I1SAR08 "You have no memory now, but in another age you were once a mighty warrior, and powerful in the mystic arts."  
I1SAR09 "We need one such as yourself to go against the cult and recover Tendrick's daughter."
I1LOC09 "I remember nothing of a past existence. If indeed I am what you say, I have no recollection of any of it."
I1SAR10 "You will re-learn all you have forgotten." 
I1SAR11 "In time you will have full recollection of your old skills, and you may even recall dim memories of your past life."
I1LOC10 "Why should I help you?"
I1LOC11 "You want me to lead your armies into battle against the priests and creatures?"
I1LOC12 "I suppose I have no choice but to take on your quest.. for now. At least until I figure out who I am."
I1SAR12 "We have rescued you from one of the deeper hells, Revenant."
I1SAR13 "I would expect some gratitude at least for that."
I1LOC13 "I did not asked to be brought back, wizard."
I1TEN09 "No, you didn't.  But it matters not."
I1TEN10 "A Revenant is forced to obey his masters, it is part of the geas  laid upon him during the summoning."
I1TEN11 "Ahhh... not exactly."
I1TEN12 "What is left of my guards must stay here and protect the town while you seek my daughter."
I1LOC14 "What, alone? What kind of numbers does this cult boast?"
I1TEN13 "Well our estimates..."
I1LOC15 "How many!"
I1SAR14 "Well into the hundreds, not including the creatures who fight for them."
I1LOC16 "Hundreds!  I may owe you for my life but this is suicide."
I1SAR15 "I trust you will find a way.  The compulsion of the geas is quite strong."
I1SAR16 "Correction, who you were." 
I1SAR17 "Your old life is gone and seeking out old memories will only bring you pain and regret."
I1SAR18 "You would do well to concern yourself only with your task, Revenant."
I1SAR19 "Take these, you will find that combined properly, these talismans can create powerful spells."
I1SAR20 "These four talismans will enable you to make 2 spells. " 
I1SAR21 "A gateway spell which will return you to this castle and a charged bolt spell which can be used for attacks."
I1SAR22 "You may also take this scroll which explains the art of spell making in detail. " 
I1TEN14 "Here is some basic armor and a sword." 
I1TEN15 "I fear I am undermanned and short on  supplies so I can offer you nothing more."
I1TEN16 "You must visit our resident combat trainer in town if you plan on re-learning your lost skills."
I1MON00 "How dare you defy us! This outrage has awakened the wrath of our lord Yhagoro!"
I1MON01 "As for you Revenant, I will send you back from where you came!"
I1SAR23 "It appears we have selected the right man for the job."
I1TEN17 "How did he get past my guards!"
I1SAR24 "I wonder, Isn't this man the same guard who was guarding your daughter on the night of her capture?"
I1TEN18 "By the gods, you're right!  Have him taken to the dungeon immediately!"
I1SAR25 "I'll see to it personally."
I1TEN19 "Locke, you have shown us already that we have chosen wisely." 
I1TEN20 "You must find my daughter and return her to me safely."
I1TEN21 "You are compelled by the geas, I know, but I beg of you, find her, please!"
I1LOC17 "Your daughter is nothing to me, as are both of you.  But the geas is stong, and I will obey you.  All I ask is that I am free to do as I please, once my task is complete."
I1TEN22 "Agreed."
I1SAR26 "Return here if you are having troubles. You will find me to be an invaluable resource."
I1TEN19 "Locke, you have shown us already that we have chosen wisely.  " 
I1TEN20 "You must find my daughter and return her to me safely."
I1TEN21 "You are compelled by the geas, I know, but I beg of you.. find her, please!"
I1SAR26 "Return here if you are having troubles. You will find me to be an invaluable resource."
I2DAL00 "So, they actually enlisted a corpse to do the dirty work."
I2DAL01 "How does it feel to be dead?"  
I2LOC00 "Perhaps you can answer that question after I've ripped your heart out and shown it to you, little man."
I2LOC01 "It feels like the touch of icy steel as it cuts across a foolish man's throat."
I2LOC02 "The fires of hell lick at ones toes, and turn ones breath to ashes.  " 
I2DAL02 "Strong words."
I2DAL03 "But words alone do not make you strong enough to fight the power of the Children."
I2LOC03 "I have some questions I need answered."
I2MIY00 "You want answers you need to talk to Geralt in the library."
I2MIY01 "I do have orders to cooperate with you so I'll answer what I can."
I2LOC04 "What can you tell me about Tendrick?"
I2LOC05 "What can you tell me about Sardok?"
I2LOC06 "What can you tell me about Tendrick's daughter Andria?"
I2LOC07 "That's all I need to know right now."
I2MIY02 "My life is his to do with as he pleases."
I2MIY03 "It saddens me to see how the Children of the Change have all but destroyed him."
I2MIY04 "His daughter was everything to him."
I2MIY05 "The old wizard?  He showed up shortly after the priests did. " 
I2MIY06 "He says he came to help us against them."
I2MIY07 "Personally, he gives me the creeps, but Tendrick seems to trust him."
I2MIYO8 "Andria isn't like the others around here.  " 
I2MIY09 "I've heard she can read the ancient language and use magic. " 
I2MIY10 "Beyond that, she is kind, beautiful, gentle and loved by everybody here in town."
I2MIY11 "I just hope she's still alive."
I2MIY12 "Yeah, sure. Whatever."
I2STE00 "I have nothing to say to the walking dead."
I2LOC08 "You have two choices. Either answer my questions or watch your intestines spill all over the floor."
I2LOC09 "Which would you prefer?"
I2STE01 "a-all right, a-ask me whatever y-you need."
I2LOC10 "Tell me about Misthaven."
I2LOC11 "What do you know about this cult?"
I2LOC12 "I need nothing further from you. I will let you live.. for now."
I2STE02 "Misthaven was a thriving port town until the cult arrived. " 
I2STE03 "There are very few people left in Misthaven these days."
I2STE04 "Of those that weren't taken by the priests, most have sailed off for safer lands."
I2STE05 "The rest just stay locked up in their houses all day."
I2STE06 "The shops are still pretty well stocked, thank the gods the cult hasn't gotten to the shipping trade yet."
I2STE07 "They've taken over half the residents of Misthaven and poisoned their minds, brainwashing them into joining the cult."
I2STE08 "Then they use our own people against us. "  
I2STE09 "It's terrible. Rumor has it they follow a priest named Yhagoro, but I have never heard the name before. "  
I2STE10 "Perhaps Geralt would know?"
I2STE11 "Then be gone you unnatural beast."
I2MOO00 "Ahh, if it isn't our undead savior. What can I do for you?"
I2LOC13 "I have some questions."
I2MOO01 "I'm not the guy to talk to. If it's answers you're looking for, talk to Sardok or Geralt."
I2GOW00 "It's a damn shame they threw Rand in here and all."
I2LOC14 "Who is Rand?"
I2LOC15 "He let the girl be captured and allowed an assassin into your Warlords chamber. Sounds to me like he's a waste of space."
I2LOC16 "You don't believe Rand deserves to be executed? "
I2GOW01 "Rand is one of my fellow castle guards."
I2GOW02 "They threw him in here for failure to perform his duties."
I2GOW03 "Rand's been with Tendrick since the beginning. He's a good man."
I2GOW04 "I can't believe he was at fault. Wrong place at the wrong time I say. "
I2GOW05 "You can't blame Rand for what happened!"
I2GOW06 "None of us are any match against those priests."
I2GOW07 "I could see punishing him, but to execute him.. that's not right. "
I2GOW08 "Yeah? Well it sounds to me like you left any sense of compassion you had back in hell."
I2LOC17 "Compassion is an excuse people make to hide the fact that they're weak."
I2LOC18 "I mean no disrespect.. you and your comrades are nothing to me.  I ask only to serve my master's wishes."
I2LOC19 "I can't remember what it was to feel compassion.  But, perhaps I was too harsh in my judgement though."
I2GOW09 "Nothing Eh?"
I2GOW10 "I can see now why your soul was burning in hell before they decided to bring you back."
I2LOC20 "If hell has robbed me of emotions that make me weak, then my time there was not wasted."
I2GOW11 "You are truly despicable." 
I2GOW12 "I have nothing more to say to you."
I2GOW13 "Perhaps there is some hope for you, ghost man."
I2GOW14 "I have nothing more to say to you."
I3RAN00 "Please, you have to tell them to stay the execution."
I3LOC00 "Stay it? I should perform it. Your are a coward.  You failed your master."
I3RAN01 "It wasn't my fault! All of my training was useless against the priests' magic!"
I3LOC01 "Tell me what you know about the priests."
I3RAN02 "I don't know anything!" 
I3LOC02 "You have had close contact with them twice and know nothing?. " 
I3RAN03 "You must believe me!"
I3LOC03 "What reason do I have to trust you?"
I3RAN04 "In the name of all that is good, I tell you I could do nothing against the priests."
I3RAN05 "They appear out of nowhere, and before you can react they are on you."
I3RAN06 "They are able enough fighters, but their insidious magic is where their true power lies."
I3LOC04 "Where do they come from?"
I3LOC05 "How do I find these Childeren of the Change?"
I3LOC06 "The monk that attacked me said something about a Yhagoro?"
I3RAN07 "No one knows where they came from."
I3RAN08 "Most of their members are inhabitants of Misthaven whom they have converted to their cause with control magic."
I3RAN09 "Some I guess came from Rugaard or some of the other western nations."
I3RAN10 "Well, the local rumors say that the Children operate mostly out of the eastern side of the island, in the old ruins."
I3RAN11 "The mountains are impassible.  The only route there lies through the caves. Many have tried that path only to be lost without a trace."
I3RAN12 "As far as I know Yhagoro is the god they worship. I had never heard the name until the cult started showing up."
I3LOC07 "It seems you do know more than you were letting on. Do you have anything else to add?"
I3RAN13 "I am only repeating things I have heard through rumor and hearsay! I am not working for the priests."
I3LOC08 "I hope you have told me everything; getting information from you later might prove difficult."
I3RAN14 "No, wait! You have to talk to Tendrick. You must stop the execution! Please. I don't want to die. Please."
I3LOC09 "Is this what men are like in this age? Begging for their lives like blubbering children."
I3LOC10 "You are a pathetic disgrace. I have no reason to help preserve your existence."
I3LOC11 "You put the life of your lord and the life of his daughter at risk. Why should they spare you."
I3LOC12 "Execution may be a bit harsh, I'll talk to them for you."
I3RAN15 "Please.. You are my last hope. If I die wrongfully it will be on your hands. Please don't let them kill me."
I3RAN16 "I have no way of fighting the priests!"
I3RAN17 "Their magic and training far exceeds my own abilities!"
I3RAN18 "Is that cause enough for death?"
I3RAN19 "You will! Oh thank you kind sir. You will not be sorry. " 
I3RAN20 "Please convince them to spare me. You must!"
I3LOC13 "Well, I hope you enjoy your final moments of life."
I3RAN21 "Wait! wait! I can tell you something more."
I3RAN22 "Being down here has given me time to think. Sardok showed up right about the same time the cult did."
I3LOC14 "And?"
I3RAN23 "Well, isn't it obvious, he's the only one besides the priests who can use magic! "
I3LOC15 "These are the ravings of a desperate man. I have no more time for this. "
I3LOC16 "I'll do what I can, but I'm not promising anything."
I3RAN24 "I have to believe you can convince them to spare me. My life is in your hands now."
I3RAN24 "I have to believe you can convince them to spare me. My life is in your hands now."
I4TEN00 "What have you learned from Rand?"
I4LOC00 "It seems they are operating out of the Eastern side of the island."
I4LOC01 "They follow the bidding of a god by the name of Yhagoro."
I4LOC02 "Rand seems innocent to me. Perhaps you should stay the execution."
I4LOC03 "Rand is definitely working for the cult, he should be executed immediately."
I4SAR00 "Yhagoro is no god."
I4TEN01 "What?"
I4SAR01 "Yhagoro is a mad priest. I met him many years ago on the mainland."
I4SAR02 "He was spouting some nonsense about questing for an ultimate power known as the Nahkranoth."
I4LOC04 "Nahkranoth."
I4TEN02 "Is it possible this priest has found the Nahkranoth?"
I4TEN03 "That would explain the sudden rise of the cult and their power."
I4SAR03 "Although it isn't very likely such an item exists, the evidence is certainly compelling."
I4TEN04 "Hmmm.. interesting. What else did you discover?"
I4TEN05 "Yes, I have heard that as well."
I4SAR04 "The ruins of the ancient temples there would make the perfect base of operations for the cult."
I4SAR05 "The only way to Eastern Ahkuilon is through the caves."
I4LOC05 "Caves?"
I4TEN06 "Yes, there is a massive labyrinth of caves which seperates Western Ahkuilon from Eastern Ahkuilon."
I4TEN07 "If you want to get to the ruins, you'll have to travel through those caves."
I4SAR06 "Was there anything else Locke?"
I4TEN08 "I too find it hard to believe one of my men failed me."
I4TEN09 "Perhaps a month in the dungeon is more appropriate. "
I4SAR07 "The guard Rand must be executed for failure to perform his duties."
I4SAR08 "Putting not only Tendrick's life but also that of his daughter Andria's at risk. "
I4TEN10 "Rand has been with me since the beginning."
I4TEN11 "Besides, I can't afford to lose any more men."
I4SAR09 "These are critical times Tendrick."
I4SAR10 "The guards fear the cult and an example must be made."
I4SAR11 "They must be forced to realize that incompetence will not be tolerated."
I4SAR12 "Was that all Locke?"
I4LOC06 "Yes, there is something else."
I4LOC07 "No, that is all I have to say."
I4SAR13 "Fine. We shall execute Rand at once."
I4TEN12 "Sardok wait! It goes against everything I have ever stood for!"
I4SAR14 "There is no other way to get the men to fight this threat."
I4TEN13 "I.."
I4SAR15 "It is the only way."
I4TEN14 "I will trust your decision Sardok. We will execute the guard Rand for incompetence."
I4TEN15 "and may the gods forgive us."
I4TEN16 "Commence with the execution."
I4SAR16 "Let this be a lesson to you all."
I4SAR17 "Those who follow Yhagoro threaten our very existence."
I4SAR18 "Any man who does not fight the cult until his dying breath will be considered an enemy of Misthaven."
I4SAR20 "If indeed the cult is located on Eastern Ahkuilon, you will need to find passage into the caves to get there."
I4SAR21 "If you find out any new information, please come back and check in with me. "
I4SAR22 "Good luck."
I5LOC00 "I have a few questions before I go."
I5SAR00 "Ask away my Revenant. I will do whatever I can to assist you."
I5LOC01 "Where am I supposed to go?"
I5LOC02 "Could you explain the magic system to me again?"
I5LOC03 "Is there anyone in particular I should be talking to?"
I5LOC04 "Thank you Sardok. I have enough information to get started."
I5SAR01 "You need to cross to Eastern Ahkuilon. " 
I5SAR02 "The only way there is through the caves and as far as I know getting to the caves can be an arduous task in it's own right."
I5SAR03 "You'll probably want to explore the town and forest first."
I5SAR04 "Of course. You must combine talismans to form spells."
I5SAR05 "Just refer to the scroll I gave you if you are having troubles."
I5SAR06 "Geralt the librarian can help you with any historical information you might require."
I5SAR07 "Jong the combat master will be essential if you hope to remember your fighting skills."
I5SAR08 "Finally you may want to visit the tavern, most rumors find their way there eventually."
I5SAR09 "Of course. Return here any time."
I6TEN00 "Have you any more information on my daughter?"
I6LOC00 "Not yet I'm afraid."
I6TEN01 "Then what are you waiting around here for?!"
I6TEN02 "Pardon my impatience but I can't bear to imagine what the cult has done with her."
I6LOC01 "If she lives, I will find her."
I6TEN03 "I have no choice but to trust you. You are my only hope. "
I7SAR00 "Locke, how goes the quest?"
I7LOC00 "I need some information."
I7LOC01 "In the forest lies an ancient tower. I need to gain access to it. " 
I7SAR01 "Ah yes, I know the one."
I7SAR02 "If my memory serves me correctly, there is an item called the Solaria or 'Golden Sun' that has something to do with the tower."
I7LOC02 "Where can I find this Solaria?"
I7SAR03 "Unfortunately my knowledge of the item is limited."
I7SAR04 "I have a feeling Geralt can help you find it. Go and visit him."
I7LOC03 "Thanks, I will."
I8SAR00 "What can I do for you Locke?"
I8LOC00 "I found this key in the tower, do you know anything about it?"
I8LOC01 "What can you tell me about this Amulet?"
I8LOC02 "I think I have everything I need."
I8SAR01 "Ahhh. You have found the Monument Key."
I8SAR02 "It is rumored that it is the only key left that will open the gate that accesses the caves."
I8SAR03 "Hmm.. Can't say that I've ever seen it before." 
I8SAR04 "Geralt is the ancient items expert, you should ask him."
I8LOC03 "It would seem I'm ready to head out for the Caves then."
I8SAR05 "It would be wise to stock up on some supplies and pay a visit to Jong before you go."
I8LOC04 "Thank you for your help Sardok."
I8SAR06 "Of course."
I9TEN00 "Welcome back Locke. How goes your quest?"
I9LOC00 "It was a long hard trek to Eastern Ahkuilon."
I9LOC01 "Now that I've arrived there I feel confident your daughter will be home safely in short order."
I9TEN01 "That is good to hear."
I9SAR00 "I apologize that it was necessary to go through all of that. " 
I9SAR01 "Unfortunately it was the only way you could recapture your combat skills. "
I9LOC02 "I understand. The time was not wasted."
I9TEN02 "Perhaps you should visit the shops."
I9TEN03 "We had a shipment of supplies come in while you were gone. "
I9LOC03 "I'll take a look, wizard. " 
I9TEN02 "Perhaps you should visit the shops."
I9TEN03 "We had a shipment of supplies come in while you were gone."
I9SAR00 "I apologize that it was necessary to go through all of that."
I9SAR01 "Unfortunately it was the only way you could recapture your combat skills."
I10LOC00 "Sardok, what do you know about the ancient queen?"
I10LOC01 "I'm ready to head back to the Ruins now."
I10LOC02 "I'll come back after I've checked out the shops in town."
I10SAR00 "What? How? I don't see how that has anything to do with your quest."
I10LOC03 "I realize that, but in the caves I saw.."
I10SAR01 "Never mind that, it's unimportant."
I10SAR02 "Are you sure you've gotten everything you need from town? "
I10SAR03 "I'll be here when you are ready."
I10LOC04 "Goodbye wizard."
I10LOC05 "Yes. I'm ready to go back."
I10LOC06 "There was one other thing.."
I11TEN00 "You seem to grow more powerful every time I see you."
I11TEN01 "It's a miracle you've survived as long as you have."
I11TEN02 "I suppose Sardok was right about you."
I11LOC00 "Thank you Lord Tendrick. I will not disappoint you."
I12TEN00 "Gods! Whats happened to you Locke."
I12TEN01 "Your eyes glow with the fires of hell."
I12LOC00 "Your daughter has been taken to Anserak, the demon realm."
I12TEN02 "What!!! How is that possible!!"
I12LOC01 "The leader of the Children,  Yhagoro,  has been consumed by the Nahkranoth."
I12LOC02 "He has ascended to the demon plane where he intends to sacrifice Andria. "
I12SAR00 "The fool intends to perform the sacrifice to open the gateway for Kraxxus himself."
I12TEN03 "What! Sacrifice my daughter!"
I12SAR01 "Locke, you have done well to recover the remaining pieces of the Nahkranoth."
I12SAR02 "Without them you could not ascend to the demon plane."
I12SAR03 "By combining my magic with your power, we can send you to the demon plane."
I12SAR04 "You must go there and destroy Yhagoro."
I12TEN04 "Wait! Stop right there. What is the Nahkranoth? Who is Kraxxus? "
I12TEN05 "And how is it that you have the ability to send people to and from the demon plane Sardok?"
I12LOC03 "Sardok! What in the name of."
I12SAR05 "I had no further use for him. We have come too far to be held up by mortals such as he."
I12SAR06 "Locke listen to me. Yhagoro was never meant to wear the Nahkranoth. "
I12SAR07 "By now you have probably realized that you are the rightful heir to the power of the Nahkranoth.  " 
I12SAR08 "You must venture to the demon plane, destroy Yhagoro, and unify the Nahkranoth."
I12SAR09 "Only then can you realize your true destiny."
I12LOC04 "Yes. I must save Andria, for she is the reincarnation of my Queen."
I12SAR10 "Yes of course.. Save the girl. Come, it is finally time."
II1LOC00 "You must be Geralt?"
II1GER00 "Yes. You look familiar. Have I met you somewhere before?"
II1LOC01 "Not unless you've been in the deeper hells recently."
II1GERO1 "What? Oh I see! You must be the Revenant Sardok has brought back to go up against the Children of the Change."
II1LOC02 "That's right."
II1GER02 "You are called Locke aren't you?"
II1LOC03 "How did you know that?"
II1GER03 "It is the name given to all the Revenants. It means 'once-living'. " 
II1LOC04 "I understand what I am."
II1GER04 "Yes and what you are is not going to make you many friends in Misthaven. "
II1GER05 "You won't find the citizens here very friendly.  " 
II1GER06 "They weren't pleased to learn that a man that's been dead for thousands of years is the one they have to depend on to save them from the cult."
II1LOC05 "And you?"
II1GER07 "Oh, I am a historian, I was hoping you could tell me about what life was like during your first existence."
II1LOC06 "I'm afraid I don't remember very much."
II1GER08 "Of course. It will come back to you in time."
II1GER09 "Now, what can I do for you?"
II1LOC07 "What can you tell me about the history of this island?"
II1LOC08 "I need to travel to the Caves, how would I do that?"
II1LOC09 "That's it for now. I'll be back later."
II1GER10 "Oh, I could go on for hours, but I think I would bore you. " 
II1GER11 "It is better to learn from books. The history of Ahkuilon is available in the book cases in this library."
II1GER12 "The Caves.. Hmmm. Certainly not an easy task."
II1GER13 "The Caves are blocked off by a gateway."
II1GER14 "To even get there you will need to travel through the forest which is very dangerous these days."
II1GER15 "Even then you still have the Ogrok to deal with. They have built their village around the Cave entrance."
II1LOC10 "Sounds like a challenge to me. Where should I start?"
II1GER16 "Well, there is this hermit that lives outside of town in a little shack. " 
II1GER17 "He has lived on this island since my great-grandfather arrived here over 200 years ago."
II1GER18 "If anyone knows how to get into those Caves, it'll be him. Be warned though, I fear he's slightly mad."
II1GER19 "Of course! If you need any further help please come and see me. " 
II1GER20 "I'm not only an expert in Ahkuilon history, but also items and artifacts. "
II2LOC00 "Are you the combat master?"
II2JON00 "I am."
II2LOC01 "I am Locke."
II2JON01 "Of course you are."
II2LOC02 "I was sent here by Sardok and Tendrick to re-learn my combat skills."
II2JON02 "Re-learn. Hmmph."
II2JON03 "Draw your sword."
II2JON04 "Hmmm. I never thought I would see that stance again."
II2JON05 "You hold your sword in the style of the ancients, it is a lost combat style."
II2JON06 "I am well versed in the combat techinques of the ancients."
II2JON07 "Perhaps I will be able to train you. Here is how it works."
II2JON08 "I will give you a certain number of combat maneuvers you must learn."
II2JON09 "You can practice them on that dummy over there until you feel you have mastered them."
II2JON10 "Once you feel comfortable with the basics you can head out into the Forest to hunt for creatures."
II2JON11 "The more field combat you get, the more powerful your attacks will become. "
II2LOC03 "I understand."
II2JON12 "I'm not finished yet."
II2LOC04 "My apologies, please continue."
II2JON13 "Return here often, especially after you have seen a good deal of combat."
II2JON14 "I will teach you new attack moves if I feel you are ready to handle them. "
II2JON15 "The more creatures you kill, the more moves you can learn. Is all this clear? "
II2LOC05 "When do we start?"
II2JON16 "I will now teach you a new technique. Pay close attention to my commands until you feel you have mastered the attack."
II2JON17 "Good work Locke. You should have enough knowledge to survive out there. "
II2JON18 "Come back and check in with me every once in awhile. "
II2LOC06 "Thank you Jong. I'll return when I've increased my skills."
II3GUS00 "Rubold! More Ale!"
II3RUB00 "You've had enough for one night."
II3GUS01 "What?"
II3RUB01 "I'm cutting you off."
II3GUS02 "I see. You're against me too? Seems like everbody's got something against me lately!"
II3LOC00 "What seems to be the trouble?"
II3LOC01 "So, you must be the town drunk."
II3LOC02 "I'm beginning to have something against you as well. "
II3GUS03 "Who're you?"
II3LOC03 "I am Locke."
II3GUS04 "Nice to meet ya Locke. Y'know, I'm not normally like this."
II3LOC04 "Oh no?"
II3GUS05 "It all started a few months back. A woman strolled into town by the name of Harowen."
II3LOC05 "Let me guess, she broke your heart."
II3GUS06 "I spent my life savings to buy her the most expensive engagement ring in the land."
II3GUS07 "Then she stole the ring from my home and ran off into the forest."
II3LOC06 "Sounds like you've been conned."
II3GUS08 "Exactly! I went after her but she locked herself up inside the ancient tower. "
II3LOC07 "I don't suppose you would know how I could enter the caves? "
II3LOC08 "What's this about the ancient tower?"
II3GUS09 "You want to find out more about the tower you need to speak to Geralt or Sardok."
II3GUS10 "All I know is you need a rare key to get in."
II3GUS11 "Caves, why on earth would you want to go there?"
II3LOC09 "I have my reasons."
II3GUS12 "Well, I do know that the Ogrok village is around there."
II3GUS13 "I think I may have an idea about how to get into that village."
II3LOC10 "Kill the Ogrok that live there?"
II3GUS14 "Ha! There's way too many of them. An army of men would be hard pressed to take them on."
II3LOC11 "So what's this idea?"
II3GUS15 "My great grandfather was known as Sohail the Ogrok Slayer."
II3GUS16 "He once told me about an amulet that he stole from the Ogrok during a raid on their villages."
II3LOC12 "An amulet?"
II3GUS17 "Yeah, the Amulet of Rogoss if my memory serves me correctly.  " 
II3GUS18 "If you had that as trade, the Ogrok might let you pass through their village."
II3LOC13 "Excellent. Where can I find the amulet?"
II3GUS19 "The amulet is on Arakna island which is on the southeast coast of Ahkuilon. "
II3LOC14 "So, how can I get there?"
II3GUS20 "You can't exactly swim it, but I do have a boat!"
II3LOC15 "Then will you take me to Arakna island?"
II3GUS21 "Sure. On one condition."
II3GUS22 "I need my money back to survive. You must get the ring back from Harowen. "
II3LOC16 "I could just take that key from you by force."
II3LOC17 "I get the ring back and you get me into Arakna island. Is that the deal?"
II3LOC18 "I have more important things to take care of right now. "
II3GUS23 "You don't want to do that."
II3LOC19 "Why not?"
II3GUS24 "The ancient tower.. it's where the thieves' guild operates out of. "
II3GUS25 "There are many legends of the treasures and magics contained within. "
II3GUS26 "These should help you if you wish to try to explore the caves. "
II3GUS27 "All I want from the tower is that ring back."
II3LOC20 "Assuming I accept you offer, where can I find this ancient tower she's hiding out in?"
II3GUS28 "It's in the forest, but you'll need to find a way in first."
II3LOC21 "Hmmm... Well if I can't figure it out maybe Sardok or Geralt know something about it."
II3GUS29 "Yes that's right!"
II3GUS30 "So we have a deal? The ring for passage to Arakna Island?"
II3LOC22 "Deal. Excellent, I'll wait for you at my house then. It's the one by the docks."
II3GUS31 "You said you needed to get to the caves!"
II3LOC23 "That's correct."
II3GUS32 "Without the amulet of rogoss you'll never make it past the ogrok camp."
II3GUS33 "And I'm the only one with a key to Arakna island which is where the amulet is. "
II3GUS34 "So it seems you don't have much choice here Locke."
II4RUB00 "Can I help you, son?"
II4LOC00 "What can you tell me about this town?" 
II4LOC01 "Who is that woman dancing over there?"
II4LOC02 "What do you know about the cult?"
II4LOC03 "I'm going to look around a bit."
II4RUB01 "Misthaven was a great place to live before the cult showed up. "
II4RUB02 "Tendrick kept things running pretty smoothly." 
II4RUB03 "These days it's more like a ghost town around here. "
II4RUB04 "That's Kylie. She's the entertainment around here. " 
II4RUB05 "Keep your hands off her and I won't have to break your arms. "
II4RUB06 "I know they've all but destroyed my business. " 
II4RUB07 "The population of this town has dropped sharply since their arrival. "
II4RUB08 "If I was 20 years younger I'd go out there myself and take 'em on. "
II4RUB09 "Normally I don't allow non-drinking customers in here, but in your case I'll make an exception."
II5LOC00 "Excuse me, I was wondering.."
II5KYL00 "Ooooh, you must be new around here."
II5LOC01 "Yes, I guess you could say that."
II5KYL01 "What can I do for you handsome?"
II5LOC02 "I'm looking for information."
II5KYL02 "Well, I probably don't have the type of information you are searching for, unless you are looking for a good time."
II5KYL03 "How do you like my dancing?"
II5LOC03 "You show a grace and beauty I have not seen in ten thousand years."
II5LOC04 "Are you kidding?"
II5LOC05 "You dance like a cow."
II5LOC06 "I have to go."
II5KYL04 "Awww...you sure know how to flatter a girl."
II5KYL05 "You don't like my dancing?"
II5LOC07 "Is that what you call it?"
II5KYL06 "I could make you change your mind."
II5KYL07 "What? You aren't captivated by the allure of my body?"
II5LOC08 "I've haven't been with a woman for a while."
II5LOC09 "But I'd wait another millenia before I touched you."
II5KYL08 "I'll see you later sweetie."
II5KYL08 "I'll see you later sweetie."
II6JON00 "So, my student has returned. Let us see how you are doing."
II6JON01 "You need to improve your skills before you are ready for the next level of training."
II6JON02 "Come back and see me after you have honed your skill a bit more."
II6JON03 "I see you have been working hard. Perhaps I can teach you some more advanced techniques."
II6JON04 "Excellent work Locke. You are well on your way to becoming a Master. "
II6JON05 "Come back and check in with me every once in awhile."
II6LOC00 "Thank you Jong. I'll return when I've increased my skills. "
II7HRU00 "Welcome to my shop."
II7HRU01 "Here you will find the finest assortment of goods, potions, and even the occasional magical item."
II7LOC00 "Let's take a look at what you have."
II7HRU02 "You don't seem to have enough gold."
II7HRU03 "A fine choice."
II7HRU04 "Will that be all?"
II7LOC01 "Yes, that's it for now."
II7LOC02 "I'd like to look at your wares once more."
II7HRU05 "Thank you kindly."
II7HRU06 "Make sure you come back every once in awhile."
II7HRU07 "New items arrive by ship all the time."
II7HRU08 "It was a pleasure doing business with you!"
II8CRO00 "This is the armor shop."
II8CRO01 "My craftings are as durable as they are unique."
II8LOC00 "I could use new armor."
II8LOC01 "Let's see what you've got."
II8CRO02 "You're going to need more gold for that."
II8CRO03 "Excellent choice. It will serve you well."
II8CRO04 "Anything else for you?"
II8LOC02 "I have all I need"
II8LOC03 "I'd like one more look at your armor"
II8CRO05 "Excellent."
II8CRO06 "Be sure and stop back often to check for new armor sets."
II8CRO07 "I hope to see you again soon."
II9GIN00 "You've come for a weapon?"
II9GIN01 "My handcrafted weaponry is the finest on all of Ur."
II9GIN02 "If killing is you're trade, I have your tools."
II9LOC00 "This is my kind of place."
II9LOC01 "Show me what you have available."
II9GIN03 "My prices are non-negotiable.. and you don't have enough gold."
II9GIN04 "As you wish."
II9GIN05 "Is that all you'll be needing?"
II9LOC02 "For now, yes."
II9LOC03 "May I see your wares once again?."
II9GIN06 "I trust you will put my weapons to good use."
II9GIN07 "I am working on a few special items, so check back with me later. "
II9GIN08 "Bloodstains had best be on that weapon when next we meet. "
II10BAY00 "Greetings Revenant."
II10LOC00 "Greetings."
II10BAY01 "I am Bayne VanGellan, some call me 'Ironhand'."
II10LOC01 "I am Locke D'Averam."
II10BAY02 "So you're the Revenant that's going  to save this blighted island, eh? "
II10LOC02 "That's what they tell me."
II10LOC03 "You don't think I can handle it?"
II10LOC04 "I'm just fullfilling my debt to the men who brought me back from the dead."
II10BAY03 "I came to this island in hopes they would hire me for the job, but it seems asthough you were hand picked."
II10LOC05 "I wasn't given much choice in the matter."
II10BAY04 "Aye, but I imagine it beats being in hell."
II10LOC06 "Good point."
II10BAY05 "Perhaps sometime in the future you could consider bringing me along on one of your quests."
II10BAY06 "I'm not much for the magic arts, but I can split an Ogrok's skull with one swing of my axe."
II10LOC07 "I could use some help. Why don't you join me?"
II10LOC08 "I'm afraid not. I prefer to repay my debts on my own."
II10BAY07 "It is a gracious offer but I have other business to attend to right now. "
II10BAY08 "Perhaps someday in the future we will have the opportunity to fight side by side."
II10LOC09 "I look forward to it."
II10BAY09 "Your words are admirable."
II10BAY10 "Perhaps when you have repayed your debt to Tendrick and Sardok we shall meet again."
II10BAY10 "Perhaps when you have repayed your debt to Tendrick and Sardok we shall meet again."
II11CAM00 "You're kind is not welcome in my home. Please leave."
II11LOC00 "Is this the way you treat those who would save you from the cult?"
II11CAM01 "I would rather face the cult than welcome a product of hell into my home.  "
II11LOC01 "It is a shame that I have been resurrected to save such a town. " 
II11LOC02 "Misthaven's outer beauty is marred by the prejudices of its inhabitants. "
II11VER00 "You must be the Revenant."
II11VER01 "Tendrick told us you would be coming."
II11VER02 "I was told to cooperate with you, so what do you need?"
II11LOC03 "Tendrick told you they resurrected me?"
II11LOC04 "I need some information."
II11VER03 "There was a town meeting a few days ago."
II11VER04 "Tendrick and Sardok unveiled their plan to deal with the cult." 
II11VER05 "Needless to say we were less than pleased that a soul rescued from hell would be our champion."
II11LOC05 "You don't trust Tendrick's judgement?"
II11VER06 "There was a time when I would never doubt a word that came out of Tendricks mouth."
II11VER07 "Ever since Sardok showed up though.."
II11LOC06 "Go on."
II11VER08 "And risk my life by execution? Ha!" 
II11VER09 "They said I had to cooperate with you but implicating Sardok is a deathwish. Good day sir."
II11VER10 "I think Geralt might be able to help you out."
II11VER11 "All my information is useless gossip."
II11VER12 "So how does it feel to be ressurected anyway?"
II11VER13 "I've already told you everything that I know."
II11LOC07 "Excuse me I was.."
II11LUC00 "Shhhh.. Quiet."
II11LUC01 "Listen to me closely."
II11LUC02 "In the forest there are some trees with knotted holes in their trunks. "
II11LUC03 "Sometimes, if you reach in you may find some treasure or food hidden there. "
II11LOC08 "How is it that you came by this knowledge."
II11LUC04 "I was robbed by some Druhg a few weeks ago."
II11LUC05 "I followed them into the forest and watched them hide their loot in the tree trunks."
II11LUC06 "Turns out they've hidden stuff all over the forest."
II11LOC09 "So, why haven't you gone and taken it for yourself."
II11LUC07 "Are you mad? There are Ogrok, Arakna, and even Lurkers out there! "
II11LUC08 "You could get yourself killed if you leave your house these days. "
II11LOC10 "Why are you telling me this?"
II11LUC09 "I'm off this island on the next boat."
II11LUC10 "I'm certainly not going to risk my neck out in those woods. " 
II11LUC11 "Since I'm leaving anyway it would be a waste if nobody recovered all that treasure."
II11LOC11 "Well then, thanks for the tip."
II11LUC12 "No problem."
II11LUC11 "Since I'm leaving anyway it would be a waste if nobody recovered all that treasure."
II11PAU00 "A stranger in Misthaven? Has a trade ship arrived?"
II11PAU01 "Oh. You must be the Revenant."
II11PAU02 "I shall not judge you, lest I be judged myself."
II11PAU03 "I realize you weren't given a choice in the matter so I cannot fault you either. "
II11PAU04 "I can only pray that the gods forgive us for raising you from the dead. "
II11PAU05 "Perhaps if you can save this town it will mean the salvation of your soul. "
II11LOC12 "You don't get out of the church much, do you?"
II11LOC13 "I appreciate your sentiments."
II11PAU05 "Perhaps if you can save this town it will mean the salvation of your soul."
II11MAU00 "You must be Locke."
II11LOC14 "Word travels fast around here."
II11MAU01 "It is a small town. What can I do for you?"
II11LOC15 "Do you have any information that might be useful to me?"
II11LOC16 "I don't need anything from you right now."
II11MAU02 "Actually I might."
II11LOC17 "What information would that be?"
II11MAU03 "There are these sundials located around the forest." 
II11MAU04 "My grandfather once told me that used properly, the sundials would lead to an item of great power."
II11MAU05 "When he died he left me a scroll and on it."
II11MAU06 "The scroll seems to be a translation key."
II11MAU07 "By the time I got around to checking it out, the forests were unsafe. " 
II11MAU08 "I will give you this scroll in return for your willingness to help the people of Misthaven."
II11LOC18 "Thank you. I will look into it."
II11MAU09 "Oh well, good luck on your quest."
II11MAU10 "Some of us trust that Tendrick knew what he was doing by bringing you here."
II11LOC19 "Your words are appreciated. I thank you."
II11HEA00 "Away from me foul demon."
II11LOC20 "Foul demon?"
II11HEA01 "I spit on you! Scum of Hades! Servant of the Dark Lords!"
II11LOC21 "Is that so?"
II11LOC22 "You have some serious issues lady."
II11LOC23 "You spit on me and I'll rip your tongue out."
II11HEA02 "Back! Back! Take your cursed vile soul away from my home!"
II11LOC25 "I am the Dark Lord's child! I shall rip out your intestines and feast on your soul!"
II11HEA03 "AIIIEEEEEEE!!!!!!"
II11LOC26 "Hmm hmm hmm.. That was definitely worth it."
II11HEA02 "Back! Back! Take your cursed vile soul away from my home!"
II12GER00 "What can I do for you?"
II12LOC00 "What can you tell me about the ancient tower?"
II12LOC01 "Nothing for now."
II12GER01 "Ah yes, the ancient tower in the forest."
II12GER02 "The legend of the tower goes back a thou.."
II12LOC02 "I don't need a history lesson, I just want to know how to get in the place. "
II12LOC03 "I've heard it is magically locked."
II12GER03 "Locked? Of course, but that lock is not magic, it just needs a special key. "
II12GER04 "To enter the ancient tower you need the Solaria or 'Golden Sun' key."
II12LOC04 "Where can I find this key?"
II12GER05 "The man who owns that key was captured by the druhg a few days ago. "
II12GER06 "His name is Jason."
II12LOC05 "Damn, I'll never find him."
II12GER07 "Actually, there is a druhg camp in the forests. " 
II12LOC06 "Excellent. Where can I find this Druhg camp."
II12GER08 "The Druhg move their camp around all the time."
II12GER09 "I'm afraid I have no idea where they are right now."
II12LOC07 "Where should I start searching?"
II12GER10 "They must still be somewhere in the forests on this side of the island. "
II12GER11 "I wish I could be more specific, but I'm afraid you'll have to find that camp by yourself."
II12LOC08 "I was afraid you were going to say that."
II12LOC09 "That shouldn't be a problem."
II12GER12 "A true warrior must be powerful in both his body and his mind."
II12LOC10 "Thanks for the information, but try to skip the ancient wisdom next time. "
II12GER13 "Was that a bit much?"
II12GER14 "Sorry."
II12GER15 "Good luck searching for the Solaria!"
II12GER16 "Fine then, feel free to browse the books."
II13GUS00 "Well, what happened?"
II13LOC00 "I got the ring back."
II13GUS01 "What about Harowen, did she say anything about me?"
II13LOC01 "Uh.. no, not really."
II13LOC02 "She said she was sorry for hurting you."
II13GUS02 "Well, it's for the best I suppose. Despite everything that has happened I forgive her."
II13GUS03 "Now, I believe we had a deal. Are you ready to head out to Arakna Island? "
II13LOC03 "Ready when you are. Lead the way."
II13GUS04 "Just let me get ready here."
II13GUS05 "Got my sword!"
II13GUS06 "Need some armor!"
II13GUS07 "Perhaps I should go with an axe.."
II13LOC04 "That's enough!"
II13LOC05 "Leave the fighting to me, O.K.?"
II13GUS08 "Aww, where's your sense of adventure."
II13LOC06 "You must be kidding."
II13GUS09 "Well, I see someone woke up on the wrong side of the resurrection altar! "
II13GUS10 "HA HA HA!"
II13LOC07 "I'm not laughing."
II13GUS11 "O.K. great then, we're off!"
II13GUS12 "Hoist the main sail!"
II13GUS13 "Secure the rigging!"
II13GUS14 "Batten down the hatches.."
II13LOC08 "It's a bloody raft you imbecile."
II13GUS15 "Some people have no imagination."
II13LOC09 "Are we almost there?"
II13GUS16 "Arakna island, dead ahead!"
II14JON00 "So, my student has returned. How goes your quest?"
II14LOC00 "I'm prepared to set out for the caves."
II14JON01 "The Caves? That will certainly put your skills to the test. " 
II14JON02 "Let us see if we can teach you some new maneuvers before you set out. "
II14JON03 "Unfortunately you are not yet ready for the next level of training. " 
II14JON04 "Perhaps you should do a bit more hunting before you leave for the caves."
II14JON05 "I see you have been working hard. " 
II14JON06 "Perhaps I can teach you some more advanced techniques."
II14JON07 "Excellent work Locke. You are well on your way to becoming a master. "
II14JON08 "Come back and check in with me every once in awhile."
II14LOC01 "Thank you Jong. I'll return when I've increased my skills."
II15GER00 "Back again Locke? What can I do for you?"
II15LOC00 "I discovered this key, what can you tell me about it?"
II15LOC01 "This 'Amulet of Rogoss', do you know what it is?"
II15LOC02 "I'm heading out for the Caves, what can you tell me about them?"
II15LOC03 "Nothing right now."
II15GER01 "Hmmm.. It is unfamiliar to me. Try asking Sardok about that one. "
II15GER02 "Ahh yes.. The infamous Amulet of Rogoss." 
II15GER03 "Thousands of years ago the Ogrok fought alongside humans in the Rugaardic wars."
II15GER04 "Blasrik, the great Rugaardic King awarded this amulet to the leader of the Ogrok as a reward for their bravery in combat. " 
II15GER05 "As I understand it, the amulet was stolen from the Akhuilonian Ogrok's and was never seen again."
II15GER06 "It was the most prized possession of the Ogrok, but be careful, they'll probably be pretty angry with you if they see you with it."
II15LOC04 "So the amulet has no magical powers?"
II15GER07 "Not so far as I know, but I can tell you that the Ogrok hold that amulet in very high regard."
II15GER08 "It's possible you could use it as a bartering tool with them. " 
II15GER09 "After all, you need to go through the Ogrok camp to get to the Cave entrance and fighting them isn't a viable option."
II15GER10 "I know the history of the Caves, but not much else."
II15GER11 "Ten thousand years ago when the great Akhuilonian empire was destroyed by the demon gods, the survivors fled to two areas."
II15GER12 "Half went underground into a vast network of dungeons underneath the city.  "
II15GER13 "The other half escaped into the caves that sprawled for miles underneath the mountains."
II15GER14 "These cave dwellers believed the destruction of their empire was due to the death of their queen."
II15GER15 "To appease the angered gods, they built a monument to the queen somewhere among the rocks, but as far as I know, no one living has ever seen it. "
II15GER16 "The entrance to the caves is guarded by the Ogroks and locked up tight."
II15GER17 "O.K., I'm here if you need me."
II15LOC05 "Thank you once again for your time."
II16GUS00 "Well it seems as though we both have what we want."
II16LOC00 "Indeed, I have the amulet and you have your ring back."
II16GUS01 "Hopefully I will see you again Locke."
II16GUS02 "You know, for a dead guy, you're not too bad."
II16LOC01 "Right. Good luck to you my friend."
II16GUS03 "May the gods guide you Locke!"
II16GUS04 "May the gods guide you Locke!"
II17RUB00 "Back again huh?"
II17LOC00 "I'm just about ready to head out for the caves."
II17RUB01 "The Caves?"
II17RUB02 "Well listen, for what it's worth I appreciate your helping us and all. "
II17LOC01 "You don't expect me to return do you?"
II17RUB03 "Well.."
II17LOC02 "What chance does one man have against an army of priests right? "
II17RUB04 "Now listen I.."
II17LOC03 "Just do me one favor."
II17RUB05 "Eh? What's that?"

II18HRU03 "A fine choice."
II18HRU04 "Will that be all?"
II18LOC01 "Yes, that's it for now."
II18LOC02 "I'd like to look at your wares once more."
II18HRU05 "Thank you kindly."
II18HRU06 "Make sure you come back every once in awhile."

II19CRO01 "I have prepared some new armor for you."
II19LOC00 "Sounds good."
II19LOC01 "Let's see what you've got."
II19CRO02 "You're going to need more gold for that."

II20LOC00 "Show me what you have available."
II20GIN02 "My prices are non-negotiable.. and you don't have enough gold."
II20GIN03 "As you wish."
II20GIN04 "Is that all you'll be needing?"
II20LOC01 "For now, yes."
II20LOC02 "May I see your wares once again?."
II20GIN05 "I certainly hope you will put my weapons to good use."

II20GIN07 "Until next we meet, farewell."
II21CAM00 "I hear you plan to trek through the caves?"
II21LOC00 "Indeed it is the only way to Eastern Ahkuilon."
II21CAM01 "I must apologize for my snap judgement of you. You are risking your life.. well, what I mean is.."
II21LOC01 "I understand."
II21CAM02 "In any case I apologize for not recognizing your willingness to help people you don't even know."
II21LOC02 "I wasn't given much choice in the matter."
II21LOC03 "Before I was hellspawn, now I'm a saint?"
II21CAM03 "Regardless, thank you for what you are doing for Misthaven."
II21CAM04 "I can offer you only my apologies for my previous actions."
II21LOC04 "Do me a favor."
II21CAM05 "Yes?"

II21VER00 "Ah, Locke. How goes the quest?"
II21VER01 "I hear you are venturing through the Ogrok camp into the caves. "
II21VER02 "Is there anything I can do for you before you go?"
II21LOC06 "Not unless you know something that may help prepare me. "
II21LOC07 "How about you just stay out of my way."
II21VER03 "Actually, I have heard some things about the Ogrok."
II21LOC08 "Tell me what you know."
II21VER04 "Well, the Ogrok are fiercely aggressive by nature. " 
II21VER05 "Don't brave that camp and expect not to get some blood on your sword. "
II21VERO6 "Prepare yourself well, the caves are deadly, but few realize that the Ogrok are just as dangerous."
II21LOC09 "Thanks for the advice, I'll remember it."
II21VER07 "Wait!"
II21VER06 "Prepare yourself well, the caves are deadly, but few realize that the Ogrok are just as dangerous."
II21LUC00 "Off to the caves huh?"
II21LUC01 "The caves are as rewarding as they are dangerous."
II21LUC02 "Keep your eye out for treasure!"
II21LOC10 "I'll be sure and do that."
II21LOC11 "I thought you were leaving on the next boat?"
II21LOC12 "You have any more advice about hidden areas?"
II21LUC03 "If I had ever been to the caves I'm sure I'd be able to help you, but going inthere is total suicide, a complete deathwish, you'd have to be crazy to.."
II21LUC04 "Oops, sorry."
II21LUC05 "Yeah, but I remembered I get violently seasick. " 
II21LUC06 "Better to face the cult than heave over the side for two weeks!"
II21LOC13 "If you say so."
II21LUC07 "Besides I think you could possibly survive. Call me crazy but I have faith in you."
II21LUC08 "Good luck out there Locke, I'll be pulling for you!"
II21LOC14 "Yeah, great ."
II21LUC08 "Good luck out there Locke, I'll be pulling for you!"

II21PAU01 "The Gods follow your travels with interest."
II21PAU02 "You may yet save your soul from damnation."
II21LOC15 "I have to stop coming in here. All that religious talk makes me sick."
II21LOC16 "I sense a greater purpose in my quest as well. "
II21PAU03 "You would be foolish to ignore the power of the Gods. " 
II21LOC17 "Right.. the power of the Gods.  For some reason that just gives me the creeps."
II21PAU04 "Well, travel well warrior. I wish you luck."
II21PAU04 "Well, travel well warrior. I wish you luck."
II21MAU00 "I hear you are leaving for the Caves?"
II21LOC18 "For people who don't get out much you people sure can gossip."
II21MAU01 "I suppose your right. There's not much else to do these days."
II21MAU02 "Watch yourself in there. Not too many people ever make it back."
II21LOC19 "So I've heard."
II21MAU03 "Good luck out there Locke."
II21MAU03 "Good luck out there Locke."

II22ELA01 "My herbs and potions will make you feel good."
II22LOC01 "Uhh.. O.K."
II22LOC02 "What EXACTLY are you selling?"
II22ELA02 "It appears you lack the funds for that purchase."
II22ELA03 "A wise decision my child."
II22ELA04 "Will there be anything else?"
II22LOC03 "I have all I need"
II22LOC04 "I'd like one more look at your supplies."
II22ELA05 "As you wish my child."
II22ELA06 "Return here anytime you feel the need."
II23TM100 "You're crazy to be wandering around the forests these days."
II23TMI01 "Good way to get yourself killed if you ask me."
II23TM200 "The cult is everywhere these days."
II23TM201 "They could have taken this town out months ago."
II23TM202 "I wonder what they are waiting for?"
II23TM300 "Have you heard about Tendrick's daughter?"
II23TM301 "The Priests of the cult kidnapped her from her bedroom."
II23TM302 "No one is safe on this god forsaken island."
II23TM400 "Gina owns the weapon shop."
II23TM401 "Her weapons are excellent, but there must be better ones out there."
II23TM402 "Wherever you may travel, make sure and search everywhere."
II23TM403 "You never know what you might find."
II23TM500 "So you're going to save us all huh?"
II23TM501 "If you ask me we should all just get on a ship to the mainland and leave this stinking island to the cult."
II23TW100 "Cronus is our armor smith."
II23TW101 "He has quite a background in military history."
II23TW102 "I hear he is working on some special armor since you showed up."
II23TW103 "I can't wait to see what he comes up with."
II23TW200 "Welcome to Misthaven!"
II23TW201 "This town is relatively safe, but the rest of Ahkuilon is very dangerous. "
II23TW202 "Please be careful if you decide to leave town. "
II23TW300 "My husband was killed by the Ogrok several months ago."
II23TW301 "Mostly the Ogrok's keep to themselves and leave us alone."
II23TW302 "But ever since the cult showed up, the Ogrok have killed several humans."
II23TW303 "I wonder why they turned against us all of a sudden?"
II23TW400 "Elahni is our resident healer."
II23TW401 "He's a good man but we wonder about the smell that comes from his house."
II23TW402 "I'm not one to gossip, but some say he smokes those healing herbs. "
II23TW403 "Why do you think he would do such a thing?"
II23TW500 "I once caught a baby druhg."
II23TW501 "I tried to make it my pet, but it refused to be litter trained so I had to let it go in the forest."
II23TW502 "Those druhg may be cute but they sure are dumb."

III1HAR00 "Welcome handsome one."
III1LOC01 "I have come to return the diamond ring you stole to its rightful owner."
III1HAR01 "You mean you didn't come to see me?"
III1HAR02 "Perhaps we can talk about the ring after we get better acquainted? "
III1LOC02 "What are you suggesting?"
III1HAR03 "You don't catch on very quickly do you?"
III1LOC03 "I don't like to play games."
III1HAR04 "Perhaps we should go upstairs to my bedroom and go from there."
III1LOC04 "I must admit, you're offer is quite tempting."
III1LOC05 "Somethings going on here. I'm being set up."
III1HAR05 "Excellent. The teleporter at the end of the hall will take you to my chambers."
III1HAR06 "I will follow you up after I change into something more.. accessible. "
III1HAR07 "Don't you want what I'm offering?"
III1LOC06 "I will not fall victim to your advances, temptress."
III1HAR08 "Temptress? I like the sound of that. Do you feel tempted by me?"

III2LOC00 "Greetings Morganna, I am Locke."
III2MOR01 "What brings you to Ahkuilon?"
III2LOC01 "I was hired by Lord Tendrick to eliminate the Children of the Change and save his daughter."
III2MOR02 "That's a tall order for one man."
III2MOR03 "I have no love for the priests cult myself."
III2MOR04 "In fact I came to Ahkuilon in the hopes of reducing their numbers."
III2LOC02 "Perhaps we can undertake this quest together."
III2MOR05 "I only fight with those I know and trust."
III2MOR06 "Perhaps it is in our future to adventure together, but for now I fight alone."
III2MOR07 "I will do my part to reduce their numbers in these forests."
III2LOC03 "I thank you for that."
III2LOC04 "Hopefully we will meet again."
III2MOR08 "Perhaps, yes."
III2LOC04 "Hopefully we will meet again."
III2MOR08 "Perhaps, yes."
III3HAR00 "Gods! You're alive!"
III3LOC00 "I am. I'm afraid I can't say the same for your pet."
III3HAR01 "You destroyed the Dragon?"
III3LOC01 "It was necessary to get the diamond ring."
III3HAR02 "I can't thank you enough!"
III3HAR03 "I was forced to steal treasure for him."
III3HAR04 "My tormenter is dead! I will never steal again!"
III3LOC02 "Somehow I have trouble believing that."
III3HAR05 "Thank you sir, Thank you."
III3HAR05 "Thank you sir, Thank you."
III4MOR00 "So you killed the Dragon."

III6GAT00 "Halt! " 
III6GAT01 "No humans beyond this point!"
III6LOC00 "I seek passage through the caves."
III6GAT02 "You seek only a death if you come here, manling."
III6LOC01 "Let me talk to the chief!"
III6LOC02 "Are you threatening me?"
III6GAT03 "He sees no one, especially not a filthy human. Now leave or die! "
III6GAT04 "If I wasn't under strict orders not to leave this post!"
III6LOC03 "Strict orders?"
III6GAT05 "We've lost many of our tribe to the human priest cult."
III6GAT06 "We have locked ourselves inside the fence for protection."
III6LOC04 "Then we have a common enemy."
III6GAT07 "I have no reason to trust you."
III6GAT08 "Only a man of great power and strength can face the Children of the Change."

III7LOC00 "Now can you take me to the caves."
III7GATO3 "You'll have to talk to the chief first. I'm sure he has a few questions about that amulet."
III7GAT04 "Follow me."
III8CHI00 "A human wearing the amulet of Rogoss!! This is an outrage!"
III8CHI01 "Where did you get that amulet?"
III8LOC00 "I recovered the amulet from Arakna Island."
III8LOC01 "I return it to you in trade for passage into the caves."
III8CHI02 "The Caves? That's suicide for a puny human."
III8CHI03 "My gatekeeper tells me you plan on destroying the Children of the Change cult as well."
III8CHI04 "What kind of idiocy is this?"
III8LOC02 "I was brought back from the dead to destroy the Children of the Change cult."
III8CHI05 "One man chosen to destroy an entire army of warrior priests? Impossible."
III8LOC03 "I recovered your amulet. I demand passage through the caves!"
III8LOC04 "I'll destroy the cult.. or die trying."
III8CHI06 "You're either suicidal or the bravest human I've ever met."
III8CHI07 "That amulet you found was given to us for bravery and valor on the battlefield."
III8CHI08 "Only a warrior of great strength and skill is permitted to wear it."
III8CHI09 "If you can show me that you are worthy of wearing it I'll allow you access to the caves."
III8LOC05 "And how do I prove that I'm worthy?"
III8LOC06 "I have nothing to prove to you."
III8CHI10 "You best watch your tongue human."
III8CHI11 "Comments like that will get it cut out."
III8CHI12 "You're not getting in those caves until you have proved you are worthy."
III8CHI13 "There is only one true test of a warrior's power.."
III8CHI14 "The Battle Arena!"
III8LOC07 "The battle arena?"
III8CHI15 "You will face the Ogrok Champion in battle."
III8CHI16 "If you defeat him, the caves are yours to explore."
III8LOC08 "Sounds like fun."
III8LOC09 "Who is this Ogrok Champion?"
III8CHI17 "Bring forth Baez!"
III9CHI00 "I don't know what kind of human you are, but you have won our respect."
III9CHI01 "The cult is threatening our existence as well as the humans."
III9CHI02 "You have proved that you may be the man that saves us all."
III9CHI03 "You can count on the support of the Ogrok in your quest."
III9CHI04 "Unfortunately most of our brothers are controlled by the cult."
III9LOC00 "Then I will free them from their misery by giving them an honorable death in combat."
III9CHI05 "You're words are as powerful as your sword."
III9CHI06 "I wish you success against the cult."
III9CHI07 "Take him to the cave entrance at once!"
III9CHI08 "I wish you success against the cult."
III10OLI00 "Made it this far have you?"
III10OLI01 "A place of many sorrows are these caves."
III10LOC00 "What can you tell me about these caves?"
III10LOC01 "Out of my way old man. I have a job to do."
III10OLI02 "Angry, angry Locke. Too much stress."
III10OLI03 "Information about the caves you will need."
III10OLI04 "Many years ago, an ancient empire crumbled to the ground."
III10OLI05 "Many people died in a great blast of fire from the sky."
III10OLI06 "Most survivors fled to these very caves. They believed the Gods to be punishing the humans over the death of their queen."
III10OLI07 "To appease the angry Gods, the survivors built a monument to the Queen somewhere within these caverns."
III10LOC02 "What does that have to do with me?"
III10LOC03 "Thanks for the history lesson."
III10OLI08 "Part of my history, part of your history."
III10LOC04 "My history? You mean my past existence?"
III10LOC05 "What does this have to do with my past existence?"
III10OLI09 "Nothing, everything, maybe something."
III10LOC06 "I grow weary of your riddles old man."
III10OLI10 "You seek to know the past, perhaps you are closer than you think to rediscovering that which you have forgotten?"
III10LOC07 "Useless musings of an old fool."
III10OLI11 "Better to be old and foolish than dead and angry."
III10OLI12 "Important now, important that you listen to me."
III10OLI13 "Trust no one, for those who appear to be helping you may have alterior motives."
III10LOC08 "And who might that be?"
III10OLI14 "Questions questions ugghhh...  Always asking questions."
III10OLI15 "You'll be needing this talisman."
III10OLI16 "To survive, you must be strong with magic."
III10OLI17 "See you on the other side!"
III11LOC00 "Excuse me I..."
III11OLI00 "Impossible! No! It can't be!"
III11LOC01 "What?"
III11OLI01 "A ghost, a ghost from the past walks among us?"
III11LOC02 "So, you too know of my resurrection."
III11OLI02 "Resurrection?"
III11OLI03 "Sardok.  I should have known."
III11LOC03 "Yes it was Sardok who brought me back. Do you know him?"
III11OLI04 "Each man follows his own path, ours have crossed before."
III11LOC04 "I was told to see you about some information."
III11OLI05 "Information? You wish to know my Druhg soup recipe?"
III11LOC05 "Uhh.. Actually I had some other information in mind."
III11LOC06 "They brought me here to destroy the Children of the Change. "
III11LOC07 "How can I recover the memories of my past life?"
III11LOC08 "I am told I must go through the caves to reach eastern Ahkuilon. Do you know of them?"
III11LOC09 "Nothing right now."
III11OLI06 "Destroy the cult? The cult? Impossible. Even for an army of men."
III11OLI07 "The ways of the blade lie strong and deep within you."
III11OLI08 "Jong the combat master he's the one you must seek."
III11OLI09 "Be wary of what you wish for."
III11OLI10 "Unpleasant memories are often best left forgotten."
III11OLI11 "Rediscover your past.  Yes, you're past. Undo what has been done."
III11OLI12 "If nothing else, this you must do."
III11OLI13 "The cave entrance is inside the village of the Ogrok."
III11OLI14 "But the Ogrok have no love for humans."
III11OLI15 "Before you go, take this talisman."
III11OLI16 "You may have known the face of death, but a resurrected warrior can be killed same as any other."
III11OLI17 "The ways of magic will be a salvation for you."
III11LOC10 "Thank you for your help."
III11OLI18 "I will see you again."
III11OLI19 "Your return to Ahkuilon concerns every man, woman, child, and beast that lives here."
III11OLI20 "Your return to Ahkuilon concerns every man, woman, child, and beast that lives here."
III12CHI00 "So the warrior-human returns. How goes your quest?"
III12LOC00 "I grow stronger with each battle. The island of Ahkuilon will be stained with the blood of the Children of the Change before long."
III12CHI01 "It is good to hear you are confident Locke, but you have only begun to realize the true power of the cult."
III12CHI02 "Perhaps the Ogrok can help."
III12CHI03 "We have decided the followers of the change are our common enemy. " 
III12CHI04 "To this end we have also decided to help you in whatever way we can."
III12CHI05 "The death of Baez has left the ownership of his legendary weapon, the mighty Soulcleaver, in question."
III12CHI06 "None is more worthy than you to wield Soulcleaver against the cult."
III12CHI07 "Therefore, I grant you the most powerful weapon the Ogrok have ever crafted, the legendary SoulCleaver."
III12LOC01 "Thank you Chief. I give you my word that this weapon will feast on the flesh of the cult."
III12LOC00 "It is good to hear you are confident Locke, but you have only begun to realize the true power of the cult."
III13OLI00 "I see you've returned. All is going well?"
III13LOC00 "The quest goes well."
III13LOC01 "I will conquer the caves soon enough."
III13LOC02 "I could use some help."
III13OLI01 "It is good to hear."
III13OLI02 "How goes your progress in the caves?"
III13OLI03 "Alone must you face this quest."
III13OLI04 "Now, tell me of the caves."
III13OLI05 "Ah yes, and perhaps learn something along the way?"
III13LOC03 "I have already learned things. " 
III13OLI06 "Oh really?"
III13OLI07 "Oh tell me what have you learned?"
III13LOC04 "I have become a more effective killer."
III13LOC05 "There is much treasure to be found in the caves."
III13LOC06 "I've learned not to listen to crazy old fools."
III13OLI08 "True I'm sure, but not exactly what I meant."
III13OLI09 "What else have you learned?"
III13OLI10 "Material wealth is the least of your worries."
III13OLI11 "Is there anything else?"
III13OLI12 "Crazy?  You underestimate my advice."
III13OLI13 "Things are never quite as they seem, remember that always."
III13OLI14 "Return here after you have completed the caves."
III13OLI15 "Realization of your true purpose here lies well within your grasp."
III13LOC07 "My purpose is to destroy Yhagoro, save Andria, and free this island of the cult. "
III13OLI16 "Not your purpose.. merely Tendrick's purpose for you."
III13OLI17 "Many are those involved with your destiny Locke.. Yes many."
III13OLI18 "But you are the only one who can decide the outcome for us all."
III13OLI17 "Many are those involved with your destiny Locke."
III13OLI18 "But you are the only one that can decide the outcome for us all."
III14LOC00 "I have completed the caves."
III14OLI00 "Visited the Queen's shrine did we?"
III14LOC01 "How did you know?"
III14OLI01 "The look in your eyes, a changed man stands before me."
III14LOC02 "I had a vision. The king and queen of the ancient empire. He killed her."
III14OLI02 "A sad moment in history."
III14OLI03 "The queen, the king, and the empire all died that day."
III14LOC03 "But why? Why would he kill her?"
III14LOC04 "Who destroyed this empire?"
III14LOC05 "Why did I have the vision. This has nothing to do with me."
III14OLI04 "Could be nothing, could be everything."
III14OLI05 "All will be learned in time."
III14OLI06 "Answers are difficult to find, yes.. but find them you must."
III14LOC06 "But where can I find answers to events that occurred ten thousand years ago? "
III14OLI07 "Those who fled to the caves were not the only ones who escaped."
III14OLI08 "A second group of survivors constructed an immense complex deep underneath the ruins of the ancient empire."
III14OLI09 "They sealed the body of their king inside a crypt at the bottom of these dungeons, so that his evil would never be released on this world again."
III14LOC07 "That must be where I will find Yhagoro."
III14OLI10 "True, yes. Perhaps the answers you seek can be found there also.."
III14LOC08 "There is something else."
III14LOC09 "That's all I can tell you about the caves."
III14OLI11 "Are you sure?"
III14OLI12 "You didn't find anything out of the ordinary?"
III14LOC10 "I found something in the queen's shrine."
III14LOC11 "This ceremonial dagger was lying there. Almost as if it was waiting for me."
III14LOC12 "I began to ask Sardok about it, but he became agitated when I mentioned the queen's shrine."
III14LOC13 "Something inside me warned me not to mention the dagger."
III14OLI13 "Oh thank the Gods! Sardok must never learn that you possess that dagger. "
III14OLI14 "Protect it, yes.. Protect it at all costs."
III14OLI15 "Take these talismans. Find your way into those dungeons, discover the truth behind the murder of the queen."
III14OLI16 "Go, Go now, I will contact you again when you have discovered the truth."
III14LOC14 "Wait, I have questions!"
III14OLI17 "Go now, before Sardok comes looking for you."
III14OLI17 "Go now, before Sardok comes looking for you."
III15LOC00 "Ughhh.. my head. What happened?"
III15OLI00 "The time has come for you to right the wrongs you have committed in your past existence Locke."
III15LOC01 "What? I.. I was the king, wasn't I? I.. I killed my queen and destroyed my empire! Why?"
III15OLI01 "The answer to your question is wrapped around your arm."
III15OLI02 "A deal with the demon god Kraxxus your forefathers made."
III15OLI03 "In exchange for the power of the Nahkranoth, each King who ascended to the throne would perform a sacrifice to Kraxxus."
III15LOC02 "But... I remember now! I didn't sacrifice her.."
III15LOC03 "I killed her to save her. Had I sacrificed her, Kraxxus would have owned her soul. "
III15OLI04 "You cheated them out of their sacrifice."
III15LOC04 "That is why they destroyed the empire!"
III15LOC05 "I must save Andria! It is time to undo what has been done."
III15LOC06 "They have taken her to Anserak, the demon realm."
III15OLI05 "Imprisoned by demonic powers is the girl. The sacrificial dagger you recovered is the only way to release her."
III15LOC07 "I must find her at once!"
III15OLI06 "She is guarded by Yhagoro. To challenge him you must understand the power of the Nahkranoth you now possess."
III15OLI07 "Three jewels, Yes three jewels the Nahkranoth is comprised of. Two are now worn by you. Yhagoro has the other. You cannot free the girl without all three."
III15OLI08 "All is not as it seems however.."
III15OLI09 "The demon god Kraxxus has his hand in this as well."
III15OLI10 "It is time you learned what you may have already suspected."
III15OLI11 "It is time you learned about Sardok's true nature.."
III15SAR00 "That's quite enough old man!"
III15OLI12 "ARRRGGGGGHHH!!!!!!"
III15LOC8 "Sardok! What have you done?"
III15SAR01 "I cannot concern myself with the ravings of an old madman."
III15LOC09 "I don't know who you are but.."
III15SAR02 "It is unimportant. All that matters is that you have recovered the Nahkranoth and are ready to face Yhagoro."
III15SAR03 "We must return to the castle at once."
III15LOC10 "I must save the girl!"
III15SAR04 "You cannot access Anserak without my help."
III15SAR05 "You have no choice. Come."
III16JAS00 "You saved me from.."
III16JAS01 "Wait a second, who are you?"
III16LOC00 "I am Locke."
III16JAS02 "Well Locke, I thank you for saving me."
III16JAS03 "Unfortunately I have no reward to give you."
III16LOC01 "I have heard you are the owner of the Solaria?"
III16JAS04 "The golden sun key, yes I keep it around my neck."
III16LOC02 "I need that key to access that tower."
III16JAS05 "Hey you saved my life, it's the least I could do!"
III16JAS06 "Things are too dangerous around here for me these days."
III16JAS07 "I'm taking the next ship to the mainland."
III16JAS08 "Thanks again for saving me!"
III16JAS08 "Thanks again for saving me!"
IV1SPI00 "Are you the one who has summoned me?"
IV1LOC00 "Summoned? What are you?"
IV1SPI01 "I am your guide through the maze of the lost souls."
IV1LOC01 "Where is this maze?"
IV1SPI02 "You stand before it as we speak."
IV1LOC02 "You will show me the way through?"
IV1SPIO3 "I will merely light the way for you."
IV1SPI04 "The maze is long, with many creatures trapped in it's darkened passages."
IV1SPI05 "Be warned that only the bravest of men will survive."
IV1LOC03 "Sounds dangerous."
IV1LOC04 "Let's do it."
IV2SPI00 "Well done brave one. We have reached the end of the maze."
IV2LOC00 "Does this mean we're at the end of the caves?"
IV2SPI01 "The Queen's shrine lies just beyond this point."
IV2LOC01 "Finally."
IV2SPI02 "However there is one more obstacle you must face before you reach the shrine. "
IV2LOC02 "Obstacle?  " 
IV2LOC03 "Whatever stands in my way will fall before my blade."
IV2SPI03 "Prepare yourself for what lies ahead."
IV2SPI04 "You may find the truth to be the worst foe you have yet to face. "
IV3SAR00 "I see you are in one piece. I trust everything went well?"
IV3LOC00 "How did you get here?"
IV3LOC01 "I made it, lets leave it at that."
IV3SAR01 "As you wish."
IV3LOC02 "I thought you said the only way to the other side of the island was through the caves?"
IV3SAR02 "I did say that, didn't I?"
IV3SAR03 "Try to understand that sending you through the caves was necessary in order for you to recover your skills in combat."
IV3LOC03 "But you could have just teleported me around the island!"
IV3LOC04 "All those quests were meaningless!"
IV3SAR04 "Hardly meaningless."
IV3SAR05 "You grow wiser and stronger with each task you complete."
IV3SAR06 "You have done very well Locke, but the road ahead will grow harder than you can imagine."
IV3SAR07 "Come now, it is time we return to the castle and report to Tendrick. "
IV4AND00 "Awaken warrior, you are not dreaming."
IV4AND01 "You must find me quickly, time is running out."
IV4LOC00 "You're Tendrick's daughter?"
IV4AND02 "In this existence, yes."
IV4LOC01 "This existence? What is that..Where are you?"
IV4AND03 "You must hurry."
IV4AND04 "Soon we will be together."
IV4LOC02 "Wait I.."
IV4LOC03 "Damn! She's gone."
V1KYL00 "Back again huh? You know something, you look like you've gotten stronger. "
VIKYL01 "Those muscles make me want to melt."
V1LOC00 "I don't suppose you have anything useful to tell me?"
V1KYL02 "A trade ship just left port yesterday. The shops probably have a bunch of new stuff in."
V1LOC01 "Thanks for the help."
V1KYL03 "Sure, anytime."
V1KYL02 "A trade ship just left port yesterday. The shops probably have a bunch of new stuff in."
V2JON00 "You seem to have learned much."
V2JON01 "I'm afraid you're not yet ready for the next level of combat maneuvers. "
V2JON02 "Come back again when you have more combat experience."
V2JON03 "The caves were a difficult trial for you."
V2JON04 "You have returned from them a seasoned warrior. " 
V2JON05 "It is time for you to learn the higher level techniques."
V2JON06 "I have never had a student yet who learns with the speed that you do. "
V2JON07 "Soon you will surpass even me. " 
V2JON08 "There still may be a few things I can teach you. " 
V2JON09 "Come back again when you feel you're ready."
V2LOC00 "Thank you Jong."
V2LOC01 "I would have never survived those caves had it not been for you. "
V3RUB00 "Welcome back Locke!"
V3LOC00 "How goes business Rubold?"
V3RUB01 "A trade ship was here yesterday."
V3RUB02 "The sailors nearly drank all the ale I had!"
V3RUB03 "Fortunately they spent enough to tide me over until you take care of our problem for us."
V3RUB04 "You are going to take care of the problem.. aren't you?"
V3LOC01 "Of course. You have nothing to worry about."
V3LOC02 "I'm going to do my best."
V3RUB05 "Do you think that will be enough?"
V3LOC03 "It's going to have to be."
V3LOC04 "Rest assurred that I will not rest until every member of the cult is killed. "
V3RUB06 "At first people thought the battle against the Children of the Change was a lost cause."
V3RUB07 "Then you showed up and now people are beginning to show some glimmers of hope."
V3RUB08 "For that I thank you."
V3LOC05 "Thank me when it's over."
V3LOC06 "I fear I have a long way yet to go."
V3RUB09 "Indeed, but still, you've managed to keep yourself alive this long and that's saying something."
V3RUB10 "Tonight your drinks are on the house."
V3LOC07 "Thank you for the kind gesture."
V3LOC08 "It is good to be welcome here."
V3RUB11 "Tonight your drinks are on the house."
V4GIN00 "I see you've been putting my weapon to good use."
V4GIN01 "I have some new items ready to show you."
V4LOC00 "Show me what you have available."
V4GIN02 "My prices are non-negotiable.. and you don't have enough gold. "
V4GIN03 "As you wish."
V4GIN04 "Is that all you'll be needing?"
V4LOC01 "For now, yes."
V4LOC02 "May I see your wares once again?."
V4GIN05 "I trust you will put my weapons to good use."
V4GIN06 "I am still putting the final touches on a few new weapons, so check back with me later."
V4GIN07 "Until next we meet, farewell."
V5CRO00 "This is the armor shop."
V5CRO01 "I have prepared some new armor for you."
V5LOC00 "Sounds good."
V5LOC01 "Let's see what you've got."
V5CRO02 "Anything else for you?"
V5CRO03 "You're going to need more gold for that."
V5CRO04 "Excellent choice. It will serve you well."
V5LOC02 "I think I have all I need"
V5LOC03 "I'd like one more look at your armor"
V5CRO05 "Excellent."
V5CRO06 "Be sure and stop back in later, I have some special armor in the works. "
V5CRO07 "I hope to see you again soon."
V6HRU00 "Welcome to my shop."
V6HRU01 "I have a few new items in along with the usual fare."
V6LOC00 "Let's take a look at what you have."
V6HRU02 "You don't seem to have enough gold."
V6HRU03 "A fine choice."
V6HRU04 "Will that be all?"
V6LOC01 "Yes, that's it for now."
V6LOC02 "I'd like to look at your wares once more."
V6HRU05 "Thank you kindly."
V6HRU06 "Make sure you come back every once in awhile."
V6HRU07 "New items arrive by ship all the time."
V6HRU08 "It was a pleasure doing business with you!"
V7GER00 "I hear you have been through the caves?"
V7GER01 "You must have seen the Queen's shrine."
V7GER02 "You must tell me about it!"
V7LOC00 "I will tell you of all I have seen in due time."
V7LOC01 "Right now I need some information on the Ruins."
V7GER03 "A bit of history is all I can offer you."
V7GER04 "The great empire that once existed on this island was destroyed thousands of years ago."
V7GER05 "The crater in the center of the islands was once thier capitol, but now the ruins on the eastern side of the island are all that remain."
V7GER06 "Many believe that a huge network of dungeons was constructed underneath these ruins."
V7GER07 "Of course, I can't confirm any of this as fact because no one who has set out to explore them has returned."
V7LOC02 "Interesting."
V7LOC03 "So I have no idea what to expect?"
V7LOC04 "That doesn't sound very encouraging."
V7GER08 "Unfortunately no."
V7LOC05 "Ah well.. I guess I wouldn't have it any other way."
V7GER09 "I'm afraid it doesn't."
V7GER10 "We have a saying about those ruins around here."
V7LOC06 "What's that?"
V7GER11 "People go in.. but they don't come out."
V7LOC07 "Is that supposed to make me feel better about it?"
V7GER12 "Well I.."
V7LOC08 "They'll have to send me back to hell before I go down. "  
V7LOC09 "I've got a bone to pick with those priests."
V7GER13 "I demand a full report when you return."
V7LOC10 "As soon as Yhagoro is defeated I'll give you enough information to fill a hundred history books. Deal?"
V7GER14 "Deal."
V7GER10 "We have a saying about those ruins around here."
V7LOC06 "What's that?"
V7GER11 "People go in.. but they don't come out."
V8CAM00 "You're back?"
V8LOC00 "You expected me to die out there?"
V8LOC01 "I'm sorry to disappoint you."
V8LOC02 "You seem surprised."
V8CAM01 "It's just that the thought that Misthaven's champion being called forth from the lower hells it's just too much for me."
V8LOC03 "Deal with it."
V8CAM02 "I find it hard to appreciate your sarcasm at a time like this."
V8LOC04 "No one asked for your appreciation, just stay out of my way."
V8CAM01 "It's just that the thought that Misthaven's champion was called forth from the  lower hells is too much for me."
V8VER00 "The Revenant returns."
V8VER01 "Most thought you would be back where you came from by now."
V8VER02 "Perhaps you are as powerful a warrior as they promised."
V8LOC05 "Perhaps."
V8VER03 "The townspeople are beginning to believe you might pull this off. "
V8LOC06 "Beginning to believe? " 
V8LOC07 "After what I've been through for this town you people should have had a damn parade waiting for me."
V8VER04 "Please understand that people have trouble accepting an undead as a their hero."
V8LOC08 "I don't care what you people think of me. " 
V8LOC09 "I'm here to do Tendrick's bidding, to save the girl, and kill priests.  If I happen to save your lives in the process, so be it."
V8VER04 "Please understand that people have trouble accepting an undead as a their hero."
V8LUC00 "How's it going with the treasure hunting?"
V8LOC10 "I'm hunting priests and creatures, not treasure."
V8LUC01 "Hmmm.. Well, have you cleaned out the caves? If there's no more danger there I could go and grab some of that booty for my own self!"
V8LOC11 "I wouldn't say the caves are free of danger."
V8LOC12 "Besides, you would have to deal with the Ogrok to even get in there. "
V8LUC02 "Damn! I forgot about the Ogrok."
V8LUC03 "Since you made it through once, would you mind going back and get me the treasures?"
V8LOC13 "You can't be serious."
V8LUC04 "Well, I figured it was worth a try."
V8LUC00 "How goes the treasure hunting?"
V8LOC10 "I'm hunting priests and creatures, not treasure."
V8PAU00 "I have prayed to the gods and they have told me to accept you into my heart."
V8LOC14 "Uh.. Thanks."
V8LOC15 "You sure are big on those gods aren't you?"
V8PAU01 "You have risen from hell through the forgiveness of the gods."
V8PAU02 "You were given the opportunity to save Misthaven to amend your past sins. "
V8PAU03 "Save us and you shall be forgiven!"
V8LOC16 "Look lady, I don't know what kind of half baked religion you subscribe to, but you're preaching to the wrong guy."
V8LOC17 "All I know of gods and their minions is what little I remember of hell, and as far as I can recall the experiences weren't particularly pleasant. " 
V8PAU03 "Save us and you shall be forgiven!"
V8MAU00 "How goes the quest Locke?"
V8LOC18 "The Ruins are my next obstacle."
V8MAU01 "Oh.. I'm sorry to hear that."
V8LOC19 "Sorry?"
V8MAU02 "There is a legend I once heard about that side of the island."
V8MAU03 "The legend spoke of a beast of ultimate destruction."
V8MAU04 "A beast armed with razor edged blades on either hand."
V8MAU05 "Known for slicing it's victims into ribbons and tearing off the head as a trophy."
V8LOC20 "Sounds like my kind of creature. " 
V8LOC21 "Great. Can't wait to meet one."
V8MAU06 "It was the legend of the giant Gordo, the golem warriors.  It scared me to death as a child."
V8MAU07 "Like I said though, it's only an ancient legend."
V8LOC22 "Legend or not, you paint a pretty nasty picture of the beast."
V8MAU08 "Just be careful."
V8MAU08 "Just be careful."
V8HEA00 "Have you rescued Andria yet?"
V8LOC23 "No."
V8HEA01 "Please hurry, only the gods know what that cult is doing with her."
V8LOC24 "I am doing what I can."
V8HEA02 "I understand."
V8LOC25 "I can promise you that if she still lives, I will return her to Misthaven. "
V8HEA03 "Thank you. " 
V8HEA04 "I believe you are sincere. Good luck."
V8HEA04 "I believe you are sincere. Good luck."
V9GUS00 "Hey! How's it going Locke?"
V9LOC00 "You seem to be in better spirits."
V9GUS01 "Indeed I am. I'm over the breakup and am doing better now that I've sold the ring back."
V9LOC01 "Good."
V9GUS02 "I hear you've made it to the Eastern side of the island."
V9GUS03 "Rumor has it that the main base of the Yhagoro cult is located in the Ruins. "
V9LOC02 "So I've heard."
V9GUS04 "Just be careful out there. Get the girl and get out. I'd hate to see anything happen to you."
V9LOC03 "For my sake or Misthaven's?"
V9GUS05 "I guess a little of both. You came through for me in a time of need, I have no reason to believe you won't do the same for our town."
V9LOC04 "Though I was compelled to start this quest, I would not abandon it now if I could. "
V9GUS06 "It seems the blood is finally flowing through your veins again.  Good luck my friend."
V9GUS04 "Just be careful out there. Get the girl and get out. I'd hate to see anything happen to you."
VI1LOC00 "Greetings stranger."
VI1NAV00 "Stranger! You don't presume to tell me you have never heard of the great Navarro Al Xace?"
VI1LOC01 "Sorry, no."
VI1LOC02 "You mean THE Navarro Al Xace?"
VI1LOC03 "No, but I assume you've heard of the great Locke D'Averam. "
VI1NAV01 "Ahhh the great.. uhhh.. no."
VI1NAV02 "The one and only, at your service."
VI1NAV03 "I am the greatest sorcerer this world has ever known."
VI1NAV04 "I suppose you have come here to seek my expertise?"
VI1LOC04 "Actually, I'm here to destroy the Yhagoro cult."
VI1NAV05 "Ahh yes, a bothersome bunch they are."
VI1NAV06 "A powerful sorcerer would serve you well in your quest."
VI1LOC05 "Would you care to join me then?"
VI1LOC06 "Do you know where I might find one?"
VI1NAV07 "Hmmm. It depends.."
VI1NAV08 "How much gold are you offering for my services."
VI1LOC07 "I offer you nothing but the thrill of combat and adventure."
VI1NAV09 "Well let's see.. Taking on the cult sounds fairly dangerous."
VI1NAV10 "Perhaps under less threatening circumstances I would join you."
VI1NAV11 "But as the greatest sorcerer in Ur, it would be too great a loss to this world if something was to happen to me."
VI1LOC08 "Yeah, right."
VI1NAV12 "We shall meet again warrior."
VI1LOC09 "I can hardly wait."
VI1NAV12 "We shall meet again warrior."
VII1JHA00 "Well, Sabu, it appears Misthaven's great savior has arrived."
VII1SAB00 "Amazing, Jhaga. I wonder how he made it this far?"
VII1JHA01 "Good question. We must not underestimate him."
VII1SAB01 "But he looks so.. weak."
VII1JHA02 "He is clearly more than he seems, and he must be stopped at all costs. " 
VII1JHA03 "Yhagoro would not forgive another delay in the search for the last two creatures. We are too close."
VII1JHA04 "Without the remaining Nahkranoth Yhagoro cannot perform the sacrifice. We must not let this man interfere."
VII1SAB02 "I will see to it personally my lord."
VII1JHA05 "Excellent. Make it... painful for him."
VII1SAB03 "As you wish my lord."
VII2SAB00 "There you are."
VII2SAB01 "We rarely have visitors down here, at least not those who come of their own free will."
VII2SAB02 "To what do I owe this pleasure?"
VII2LOC00 "I am Locke. I have come to destroy you and all the rest of your 'Children'."
VII2SAB03 "Locke? A Revenant? They think a ghost such as you can stop the Children of the Change, and the mighty god Yhagoro?"
VII2LOC01 "You are not Yhagoro?"
VII2SAB04 "No, no, I am but his loyal servant. You may call me Sabu."
VII2SAB05 "I am the overseer of these dungeons and high priest of the order."
VII2SAB06 "Why do you seek to destroy the followers of Yhagoro?"
VII2LOC02 "You abducted the girl Andria, terrorized the people of Misthaven, and enslaved the creatures of Ahkuilon."
VII2LOC03 "Enough words. Time to die."
VII2SAB07 "All true. Unfortunately there is nothing you are capable of doing about it. "
VII2SAB08 "Kneel before me at once and I may spare your life."
VII2SAB09 "Do not insult my power. I could destroy you with a wave of my hand. You will kneel before me at once."
VII2LOC04 "You want me to kneel?"
VII2LOC05 "You'll have to kill me first."
VII2SAB10 "As much as I would love to stay and play, I have pressing business elsewhere. "
VII2SAB11 "But let me assure you that you will not leave this dungeon alive."
VII2LOC06 "I'm going to enjoy killing that bastard."
VII2SAB12 "You again?"
VII2SAB13 "I've had just about enough of this."
VII2SAB14 "With my Elemental spell I will be rid of you forever."
VII2SAB15 "What? This is impossible! How could you?"
VII2SAB16 "That talisman, it's rendered me powerless!"
VII2LOC07 "Are you having a problem, Sabu?"
VII2SAB17 "Where did you...? How could...?"
VII2SAB18 "This isn't over."
VII2SAB19 "When next we meet I'll put an end to your pitiful existence."
VII2LOC08 "When next we meet I'll make sure you have no arms left to cast that damn teleport spell."
VII3HOR00 "Your majesty, this is an unexpected surprise."
VII3LOC00 "Do I know you spirit?"
VII3HOR01 "Have you forgotten the pain and suffering you caused?"
VII3HOR02 "The destruction of an empire caused by your actions?"
VII3LOC01 "Who the hell are you anyway?"
VII3LOC02 "I know nothing of these things."
VII3HOR03 "I am Horatio, high priest of the ancient order, and servant of the great empire of Ahkuilon... and it's Emperor."
VII3HOR04 "I see... It is a shame that you are not haunted by the screams of the thousands who lost their lives as a result of your selfishness."
VII3LOC03 "I don't know who you are or what you speak of but I tire of this conversation. "
VII3LOC04 "Either return from where you came or prepare to be sent back there permanently. "
VII3HOR05 "I spent my entire mortal existence serving you as my king. "
VII3HOR06 "I absolve myself of this servitude with one final act. "
VII3HOR07 "In front of you is a chest. "
VII3HOR08 "Contained within is a powerful object. "
VII3HOR09 "Take it with you if you hope to escape from here alive. "
VII3HOR10 "If you succeed in this quest you may yet free me from this undead hell. "
VII3HOR11 "I help you for that reason alone. "
VII3HOR12 "Farewell your majesty. "
VII3LOC05 "Whoever that was I think he was trying to help me. "
VII3LOC06 "I should probably grab that talisman he was talking about. "
VII4LOC00 "I think I hear some voices over there."
VII4LOC01 "I better go check it out."
VII4URG00 "Shhh. Quiet you guys, I think I smell something."
VII4URG01 "I know that smell.... human."
VII4SLA00 "Yeah, I think your right, definitely a human."
VII4MOR00 "Let's get him!"
VII4SLA01 "Now hold on just a second..."
VII4MOR01 "What is it?"
VII4SLA02 "Well, we're reasonably intelligent monsters."
VII4SLA03 "That human might have a nasty sword and powerful armor."
VII4SLA04 "We don't have to mindlessly rush at every human that comes through here like those idots in Tristram."
VII4MOR02 "Good point."
VII4URG02 "Makes sense to me."
VII4SLA05 "If we hide in here maybe he won't notice us."
VII4MOR03 "Sounds like a plan."
VII4URG03 "Count me in."
VII4SLA06 "Shhhh.. everyone be real quiet."
VII4LOC02 "I can't believe what I just heard."
VII4LOC03 "I should kill them on principle alone."
VII5CHE00 "Welcome my lord."
VII5CHE01 "Where are your robes?"
VII5LOC00 "I'm no priest."
VII5CHE02 "No? What are you doing down here?"
VII5LOC01 "I'm here to destroy Yhagoro and bring down the cult."
VII5CHE03 "Really. I'd love to believe that. It would be nice to return to my village."
VII5LOC02 "Why don't you just leave?"
VII5CHE04 "The priests have control magic. I couldn't leave if I wanted to."
VII5LOC03 "What is this place?"
VII5LOC04 "Who are you?"
VII5CHE05 "My name is Bullthwort, but most call me the chef."
VII5CHE06 "This is the kitchen. We make all the food for the priests and the slaves here. "
VII5LOC05 "Slaves?"
VII5CHE07 "Yeah. The priests have enslaved hundreds of creatures to search for the Nahkranoth lair in these dungeons."
VII5LOC06 "They haven't found it yet?"
VII5CHE08 "Nope. And it's driving them crazy."
VII5LOC07 "Thanks for the information."
VII5CHE09 "If it means my freedom, I'll do anything I can to help."
VII5CHE09 "If it means my freedom, I'll do anything I can to help."
VII6LOC00 "What kind of sick place is this."
VII6LOC01 "This is the most sadistic thing I have ever witnessed. "
VII6TOR00 "Yeah.. great isn't it."
VII6TOR01 "This is the Chamber of Horrors."
VII6TOR02 "Here we break the will of those who refuse to swear loyalty to Yhagoro. "
VII6TOR03 "Who are you anyway, I don't see your name on the list for today. Are you scheduled for torture?"
VII6LOC02 "Not unless you think you can force me into one of these contraptions. "
VII6TOR04 "Oh, I think I understand. You're one of 'those' people."
VII6TOR05 "I'm not supposed to do this, but I can give you a pretty severe whipping for 100 gold."
VII6TOR06 "I guarantee it will satisfy your appetite for pain."
VII6LOC03 "I don't receive pain.. I deal it."
VII6TOR07 "Oh! I see, you're looking for a job here."
VII6LOC04 "This is getting me nowhere, I'm leaving."
VII6TOR05 "I'm not supposed to do this, but I can give you a pretty severe whipping for 100 gold."
VII7LOC00 "Your time has come, priest."
VII7WAN00 "No! Warrior, please sheathe your weapon. We fight for the same cause! "
VII7LOC01 "A man who begs for his life disgusts me."
VII7LOC02 "Accept punishment for your actions and die with dignity."
VII7WAN01 "But you have me wrong, noble warrior. I hate my former bretheren as much as you do."
VII7WAN02 "I work against them even now."
VII7LOC03 "Oh, really?"
VII7LOC04 "I trust no man...."
VII7WAN03 "I can not prove myself to you, but you would be foolish to destroy one of the few allies you may have in these dungeons."
VII7WAN04 "I have several talismans I've stolen from my masters. Take them as proof that I am what I say I am."
VII7WAN05 "Yes!  As a practitioner of the magic arts I realized the priests' power was their power over the mind."
VII7WAN06 "If they lost this ability, their followers would desert them.  I joined their order to discover this secret and to use it against them."
VII7LOC05 "And why haven't they noticed this?"
VII7WAN07 "As a cover, I learned to concoct these control potions for them."
VII7WAN08 "They trust me with access to all the ingredients, and an understanding of how to counteract them."
VII7LOC06 "I suppose I have no choice but to trust you for now."
VII7LOC07 "If I discover that this was all a lie created to save yourself. I promise you an excruciatingly painful death."
VII7WAN09 "Let me leave you with a word of advice before you go."
VII7WAN10 "Beware of Jhaga and Sabu. Their magical powers far exceed any I've seen before."
VII7LOC08 "I'll remember that."
VII7WAN09 "Let me leave you with a word of advice before you go."
VII7WAN10 "Beware of Jhaga and Sabu. Their magical powers far exceed any I've seen before."
VII8LOC00 "What are you doing here?"
VII8DR100 "Shhh.. Druhg get sent to chamber of horrors for reconditioning if caught talking. "
VII8DR101 "Druhg are under the priests' control magic."
VII8LOC01 "I'll have you free soon enough."
VII8DR102 "Druhg know no freedom, only slavery."
VII8LOC02 "There must be some way to free you."
VII8DR103 "Enough talk.. Druhg get back to work before the priests come. "
VII8LOC03 "Hey... You guys have got to get out of here!"
VII8DR200 "Down here Druhg never leave."
VII8LOC04 "You don't understand.. I've killed all your guards!"
VII8DR201 "Dungeons make human stupid. Happen all the time down here. "
VII8LOC05 "I'm not stupid! I'm here to destroy the cult!"
VII8DR202 "Then Druhg are in worse shape then thought."
VII8DR203 "Druhg keep working and maybe they not punish me for talking. "
VII8LOC06 "But.."
VII8DR204 "Is only one way to free Druhg. Human must kill Sabu and break control spell. "
VII8LOC07 "Kill Sabu? I was hoping you were going to say that."
VII8DR205 "No more talk. Druhg work now. Human return when Sabu is dead. "
VII8DR205 "No more talk. Druhg work now. Human return when Sabu is dead. "
VII8LOC08 "I'm here to help you escape."
VII8DR300 "Druhg cannot escape."
VII8LOC09 "You need to get out of here now!"
VII8LOC10 "I'm tired of trying to help you stupid creatures."
VII8LOC11 "I'm sorry..."
VII8DR301 "Druhg rather die working than get torn apart by guards."
VII8LOC12 "It can't be that bad.. Can it?"
VII8DR302 "Ogrok use Druhg who try to escape as football in big game last week. "
VII8LOC13 "Gods.. That's horrible."
VII8DR303 "Druhg forced to come here. You came on your own. Who stupid now? "
VII8DR300 "Druhg cannot escape."
VII9SAB00 "So we meet again."
VII9SAB01 "I have orders to kill you on sight.. but after the problems you've caused I have something a little more creative in mind."
VII9LOC00 "You think those Kanthas can protect you?"
VII9LOC01 "You haven't even begun to see..."
VII9LOC02 "Just do me one favor...."
VII9SAB02 "Your threats, however entertaining, are pathetic. " 
VII9SAB03 "You truly have no idea what you are up against. Allow me to introduce you to a world of misery and suffering beyond your wildest nightmares."
VII9SAB04 "You will be sent to the slave camp at once. There you will learn what it means to be broken."
VII11SHE00 "Well hello handsome!"
VII11SHE01 "I am singl.. I mean Shegra. And you?"
VII11LOC00 "I am Locke."
VII11SHE02 "What a strange name for my lover to be called."
VII11LOC01 "What the hell are you talking about!"
VII11LOC02 "I'm a human."
VII11LOC03 "I've been down here so long, even you are beginning to look good"
VII11SHE03 "Hee hee hee"
VII11SHE04 "Locke Shegra's man."
VII11SHE05 "Shegra human too."
VII11LOC04 "Your skin is blue and you are under three feet tall."
VII11LOC05 "You're either a druhg or a smurf."
VII11SHE06 "Why you come for Shegra then?"
VII11LOC06 "I am a human warrior sent here to destroy the preists who call themselves the Children."
VII11LOC07 "Sabu cast some kind of spell on me that teleported me down to this slave camp. "
VII11SHE07 "If what you say true, you should kill Sabu. Would free Druhg of control spell. "
VII11LOC08 "I like the way you think. I want nothing less then to kill that bastard. "
VII11SHE08 "Shegra have an idea. Shegra have deadly poison weapon."
VII11SHE09 "All Locke need to do is sneak up behind Sabu and cut him with it. Sabu die instantly."
VII11LOC09 "Excellent! Thank you!"
VII11SHE10 "There is a price.."
VII11LOC10 "Oh?"
VII11LOC11 "I'm not sure I want to hear this.."
VII11SHE11 "In exchange for helping Locke, Shegra demand Locke return to camp to free Druhg slaves once Sabu is dead."
VII11LOC12 "Is that it?"
VII11SHE12 "and a kiss for Shegra."
VII11LOC13 "A what????"
VII11SHE13 "Locke have no choice if want to kill Sabu."
VII11LOC14 "Well.. fine."
VII11LOC15 "No way."
VII11SHE14 "Shegra not help Locke until he kiss her."
VII11SHE15 "Mmmm.. That was wonderful."
VII11LOC16 "You slobbered all over my face!"
VII11SHE16 "Wonderful, wasn't it."
VII11LOC17 "I'm disgusted with myself. I wasn't even drunk."
VII12DR100 "Human have given Druhg freedom."
VII12DR101 "How can Druhg ever thank you?"
VII12LOC00 "Just tell me where I can find Yhagoro."
VII12LOC01 "You guys have any idea how to get out of here?"
VII12DR102 "Druhg been here long time, only know how to search for Nahkranoth jewel."
VII12LOC02 "The Nahkranoth is here?"
VII12LOC03 "Where can I find it?"
VII12DR103 "Druhg slaves search for many years, find nothing."
VII12DR104 "Yhagoro? Who is Yhagoro?"
VII12LOC04 "The head priest of the cult."
VII12DR105 "Priest in charge called Jhaga."
VII12LOC05 "Jhaga? Where can I find him?"
VII12DR106 "Passage in the guard captain's room."
VII12DR200 "Druhg stole the key to that room from guards weeks ago!"
VII12DR201 "Human take key, it is only way to find Jhaga."
VII12LOC06 "You druhg make for the surface. I'll take things from here."
VII12LOC07 "You druhg make for the surface. I'll take things from here."
VII13JHA00 "You! How dare you enter these chambers."
VII13LOC00 "Take me to Yhagoro. I've come for his head."
VII13JHA01 "Fool! You think you have a chance of destroying Yhagoro?"
VII13JHA02 "Yhagoro is nothing less than a god!"
VII13LOC01 "Take me to him or die."
VII13JHA03 "Oh no my friend, it is you who are going to die."
VII13JHA04 "Yhagoro has transcended to the demon plane of Anserak and taken the girl with him."
VII13JHA05 "The only way to transcend to Anserak is to possess the Nahkranoth."
VII13JHA06 "So my friend, it appears your quest ends right here."
VII13LOC02 "Make no mistake. I will find the Nahkranoth, destroy Yhagoro, and save the girl. "
VII13JHA07 "Is that so? I'm afraid you'll have to come through me first."
VII13LOC03 "I was hoping you would say that."
VII13JHA08 "He who has been chosen to wear the Nahkranoth will be shown the way."
VII15AND00 "You have done well warrior."
VII15LOC00 "What's happened to me?"
VII15AND01 "You possess what was rightfully yours."
VII15AND02 "The Nahkranoth will lead you to me."
VII15LOC01 "But how.."
VII15LOC03 "Soon my love, soon we will be together again."
VII15LOC02 "Again???"
VIII1GUS00 "Locke. Good god man what's happened to you?"
VIII1GUS01 "You're eyes glow red with the fires of hell."
VIII1GUS02 "I don't know what happened to you in those dungeons, but the scent of evil is heavy upon you now."
VIII1LOC00 "It must be the Nahkranoth. The power flowing through me is tremendous."
VIII1GUS03 "Power like that can consume a man. You must keep your will over this power intact."
VIII1GUS04 "Whatever this 'Nahkranoth' is, I'm sure it's dangerous. " 
VIII1LOC01 "Dangerous to all who stand in my path."
VIII1GUS05 "You may have paid a higher price than you know to destroy those priests, my friend."
VIII1LOC02 "With the power I now possess, the Children of the Change will be crushed before me."
VIII1GUS06 "Yeah, just be careful it doesn't take you with it."
VIII1GUS07 "You may have paid a higher price than you know to destroy those priests, my friend."
VIII2KYL00 "What the.."
VIII2KYL01 "What's happened to you?"
VIII2LOC00 "I have acquired the power necessary to destroy the cult."
VIII2KYL02 "What kind of power? You look like a demon."
VIII2LOC01 "A power beyond your comprehension. A power once stolen from me ten thousand years ago."
VIII2KYL03 "You've.. you've gone crazy."
VIII2LOC02 "The Nahkranoth was rightfully mine all along."
VIII2KYL04 "I uh.. I think you better leave me alone. " 
VIII2KYL05 "Whatever this Nanakoff is, I don't want any part of it.. or you."
VIII2KYL06 "You've.. you've gone crazy."
VIII3LOC00 "I have come to complete my training."
VIII3JON00 "I.."
VIII3LOC01 "Are you listening to me? I need to complete my training."
VIII3JON01 "I will not teach one who has accepted the power of evil into his soul."
VIII3LOC02 "I have only done what is necessary in order to destroy Yhagoro."
VIII3LOC03 "I would have no chance without these creatures."
VIII3JON02 "Regardless, I will teach you nothing more."
VIII3LOC04 "I require the final attack maneuvers to complete my quest. You must teach me."
VIII3JON03 "I have trusted you so far Revenant, but now I am not sure. The power would be too great. The risk too high."
VIII3LOC05 "There is no other way. I'm not asking you. I'm telling you. If you refuse, this entire world will perish."
VIII3JON04 "It is against my better judgement, but I will trust you once more. Let us begin."
VIII4LOC00 "Rubold."
VIII4RUB00 "By all that is holy! Locke, what's happened to you?"
VIII4LOC01 "I now posess the power of the priests."
VIII4RUB01 "Gods, but I can feel the evil emanating from you. Have you destroyed the cult?"
VIII4LOC02 "I prepare to travel to the demon realm of Anserak. There I will face Yhagoro in a battle of epic proportions."
VIII4RUB02 "Hey that's great. Not for nothing, but would you mind leaving? You're eyes are glowing red and it's scaring my customers away."
VIII4RUB03 "By all that is holy! Locke, what's happened to you?"
VIII5GIN00 "Your power has exceeded anything I have ever seen before."
VIII5GIN01 "I suppose you'll be needing a weapon that is worthy of you."
VIII5LOC00 "Show me what you have available."
VIII5GIN02 "My prices are non-negotiable.. and you don't have enough gold."
VIII5GIN03 "As you wish."
VIII5GIN04 "Is that all you'll be needing?"
VIII5LOC01 "For now, yes."
VIII5LOC02 "May I see your wares once again?."
VIII5GIN05 "You should be powerful enough for just about anything now."
VIII5GIN06 "Do me a favor and spill some blood for me out there."
VIII5GIN07 "Until next we meet, farewell."
VIII6CRO00 "What on Ur happened to.."
VIII6LOC00 "I need the most powerful armor you have"
VIII6CRO01 "I can't. I simply couldn't allow it to fall into the wrong hands."
VIII6CRO02 "It's just too powerful."
VIII6LOC01 "Misthaven and Andria depend on it"
VIII6LOC02 "Show me what you have.. Now."
VIII6CRO03 "You're going to need more gold for that."
VIII6CRO04 "Excellent choice. It will serve you well."
VIII6CRO05 "Is that all?"
VIII6LOC03 "I have all I need"
VIII6LOC04 "Let's have another look at that armor."
VIII6CRO06 "If anything can break through that armor, I've yet to see it."
VIII6CRO07 "I hope you make it back alive."
VIII7HRU00 "What has happened to.."
VIII7LOC00 "I'd like to check out your goods once more."
VIII7HRU01 "You're a little short in the gold department."
VIII7HRU02 "I congratulate you on your choice."
VIII7HRU03 "Will that be all?"
VIII7LOC01 "Yes, that's it for now."
VIII7LOC02 "I'd like to look at your wares once more."
VIII7HRU04 "Thank you."
VIII7HRU05 "Where ever it is you are going.. good luck."
VIII8GER00 "It's finally happened. You have the Nahkranoth."
VIII8LOC00 "How did you know?"
VIII8LOC01 "It was necessary in order to gain the power needed to face Yhagoro."
VIII8LOC02 "You knew this was going to happen?"
VIII8GER01 "You have taken on the features of a demon. I could sense the power of that thing the second you walked through the door."
VIII8GER02 "I had my suspicions. I did some research and came across a painting of you. "
VIII8GER03 "The ancient prince who destroyed an empire by angering the demon gods. It was all because of the Nahkranoth wasn't it?"
VIII8LOC03 "It was only a matter of time before I reclaimed what was rightfully mine. Now I can finally face Yhagoro and reunite the Nahkranoth."
VIII8GER04 "I had feared that all along. A battle between two men who wear the Nahkranoth could destroy the world."
VIII8LOC04 "True, but that battle will not be fought on this world."
VIII8GER05 "You mean to travel to another plane?"
VIII8LOC05 "I must face Yhagoro on Anserak, the demon plane."
VIII8GER06 "It is worse than I had imagined. May the gods save us all."
VIII8LOC06 "The gods have nothing to do with it.  I am the only one who can save you now. "
VIII8GER07 "Perhaps, but when you've completed your quest and destroyed these priests, who is going to save you?"
VIII8GER06 "It is worse than I had imagined. May the gods save us all."
VIII9SAR00 "Are you prepared?"
VIII9LOC00 "Yes. Yhagoro will cower before the power of the Nahkranoth."
VIII9SAR01 "Have you forgotten that Yhagoro wears one of the demon creatures himself? "
VIII9LOC01 "Of course not.  He wields the master demon, and is a formidable enemy. " 
VIII9LOC02 "But I was born to wield the Nahkranoth, and it feels as though it has always been a part of me. "  
VIII9LOC03 "I must trust the memories of my former life to protect me."
VIII9LOC04 "Take me to Anserak. It is time to finish this."
VIII9SAR02 "As you wish." 
IX1LOC00 "Yhagoro."
IX1YHA00 "Who dares enter my lair?"
IX1YHA01 "What? So now I discover why my slaves have failed to find the final Nahkranoth pieces."
IX1YHA02 "Where did you?"
IX1LOC01 "Enough talk. I have come to end your reign of terror over Ahkuilon."
IX1YHA03 "Can this be? Do you mean to challenge a chosen disciple of Kraxxus?"
IX1LOC02 "I mean to watch you die."
IX1YHA04 "The Nahkranoth belongs to me. " 
IX1YHA05 "I will tear them from your broken corpse."
IX1LOC03 "This has gone on long enough. It ends here."
IX1YHA06 "You wish to fight me. Then prepare to meet your doom. " 
IX1YHA07 "It is time you learned the true meaning of suffering."
IX2LOC00 "NOOOOOOOO!"
IX2SAR00 "Ten thousand years ago you refused to perform the sacrifice.  Now it no longer matters, the pact is restored."
IX2LOC01 "Phom.. my tormentor..  Now I remember you! "  
IX2SAR01 "Fool! Do you honestly believe you can break a pact with the elder gods and not pay the price?"
IX2LOC02 "I have been a pawn, and a slave, but NO MORE!"
IX2LOC03 "The pact IS restored, and now I am no less powerful than you!"
IX2LOC04 "I will have my REVENGE!"
IX3SAR00 "This.. this is impossible ."
IX3SAR01 "This is far from over my friend."
IX3SAR02 "You.. are.. still.. a slave."
X1LOC00 "Time to die."
X1LOC01 "Button mashing never solved anything."
X1LOC02 "You'll feel that in the morning."
X1LOC03 "Death be not proud."
X1LOC04 "Your blood is not worthy of my blade."
X1LOC05 "Oh God.. The pain!!"
X1LOC06 "Arrraaaaagggghhhh!"
X1LOC07 "Ack.. uhah..uhhhee.. ahhhhhhh."
X1LOC08 "Oppose me.. and die."
X1BAY00 "Try not to get your blood all over me."
X1BAY01 "Have at you!"
X1BAY02 "There is no honor in your death."
X1BAY03 "Cower before my might."
X1BAY04 "You'll pay for that."
X1BAY05 "Retreat!"
X1BAY06 "Mwwwwwwaaarrrraaaahhhhhh!!!"
X1BAY07 "I have.. huuuhhh.. ex.. pired."
X1BAY08 "Don't take this slaughter personally."
X1MOR00 "Bring it on!"
X1MOR01 "You can stop staring at my chest now."
X1MOR02 "Your weapon seems rather.. small."
X1MOR03 "Beaten up by a woman.. what a disgrace."
X1MOR04 "This won't hurt.. much."
X1MOR05 "What kind of poor excuse for a man are you?"
X1MOR06 "I'm ALL natural sweetheart."
X1MOR07 "SHRIIIEEEKK."
X1MOR08 "Huuu.. Huuuu..  Whhhhy..?"
X1NAV00 "Time for a Bar-B-Q!"
X1NAV01 "You did say extra crispy, didn't you?"
X1NAV02 "Now that is what I call frigid."
X1NAV03 "Nothing can save you now"
X1NAV04 "How dare you strike a wizard!"
X1NAV05 "This is going to hurt."
X1NAV06 "Chanting"
X1NAV07 "Must.. find.. ressurection.. spe.. aghuchhh"
X1NAV08 "Run away!!!  Run Away!!!"
X1NAV09 "I spit on you!!.. Phtoooie!"
XI1SAR00 "The mighty Bayne Ironhand."
XI1SAR01 "You were chosen for your reputation in combat."
XI1SAR02 "I trust you will not dissapoint us."
XI1BAY00 "Just tell me when I get paid."
XI1BAY01 "You have nothing to worry about."
XI1SAR03 "When the girl is returned and the cult is eliminated you will be paid in full."
XI1SAR04 "If I had any reservations, you'd never have been hired."
XI2SAR00 "Ahh.. Morganna."
XI2SAR01 "As beautiful as you are deadly."
XI2SAR02 "Your mission is simple."
XI2SAR03 "The more you kill, the higher your reward."
XI2MOR00 "Killing is it's own reward."
XI2MOR01 "I'm not sure you can afford what you are offering."
XI2SAR04 "Spoken like a true assassin."
XI2SAR05 "I have no doubt you will serve us well."
XI2SAR06 "You just worry about delivering on your end."
XI2SAR07 "I'll make sure you are taken care of."
XI3SAR00 "Navarro De Vray Al Xace."
XI3NAV00 "The one and only."
XI3SAR01 "Let's hope your power in magic can back up your wild claims."
XI3NAV01 "Do you dare question the power of an Al Xace?"
XI3NAV02 "Have no fear. The world of Ur has never before seen power like mine."
XI3SAR02 "Of course not. But you sir, are no Al Xace"
XI3NAV03 "I see you doubt me."
XI3SAR03 "Complete the quest, then perhaps my opinions will change."
XI3SAR04 "I'm sure."
XI4TEN00 "The mighty Bayne VanGellan."
XI4TEN01 "Your presence here is an honor to all Misthaven. " 
XI4BAY00 "I fear most would not agree with your sentiments."
XI4BAY01 "The honor is mine Lord Tendrick."
XI4TEN02 "I am not one to dwell on past events."
XI4TEN03 "Right or wrong, your decisions on the battlefield were made with bravery and conviction."
XI4BAY02 "I thank you for your support Lord Tendrick."
XI4TEN04 "It is good to be in the company of a former Rugaardic War veteran."
XI4TEN05 "Your honor and bravery should serve as an example to your fellow adventurers."
XI5TEN00 "I have no respect for your kind."
XI5TEN01 "Thieves and assassins are cowards with no honor."
XI5MOR00 "We are merely killers like yourself, only.. more efficient."
XI5MOR01 "You hired me yourself, what does that say about you?"
XI5TEN02 "I am a soldier, not a killer."
XI5MOR02 "I fail to see the difference."
XI5TEN03 "Getting my daughter back is the only thing that matters anymore."
XI5TEN04 "If it means forsaking my personal beliefs and morals, then so be it."
XI6NAV00 "A word in private if you will Lord Tendrick?"
XI6TEN00 "What is it?"
XI6NAV01 "It's about the payment for this quest."
XI6NAV02 "I am quite accomplished as a court advisor."
XI6TEN01 "You will be rewarded upon Andria's return."
XI6NAV03 "It is the amount of the reward sir."
XI6NAV04 "Based on my superior power and skill, I believe I am entitled to a substantial bonus over my counterparts here."
XI6TEN02 "An awfully brash thing to say considering the company you are in."
XI6NAV05 "Yes, but.."
XI6TEN03 "The price of the reward is fixed, you will all be rewarded equally."
XI6TEN04 "What are you saying?"
XI6NAV06 "Perhaps I could be used more effectively at your side rather than in the field."
XI6TEN05 "But the party needs a sorcerer."
XI6NAV07 "Exactly why you should send Sardok."
XI6TEN06 "I suggest you hold your tongue and do the job you were hired for."
XI6NAV08 "Just a suggestion my lord."
XI7GUA00 "The legendary Bayne VanGellan."
XI7GUA01 "It is an honor sir."
XI7BAY00 "As you were soldier."
XI7BAY01 "Tendrick has trained a fine group of men here, you should all be proud."
XI8GUA00 "A beautiful woman who carries a weapon?"
XI8GUA01 "Is this some kind of joke?"
XI8MOR00 "Yes, the kind of joke that can cut your throat out and watch you die slow."
XI8GUA02 "Mm.. My mistake."
XI9GUA00 "They hired a midget to take on the cult."
XI9GUA01 "What were they thinking?"
XI9NAV00 "This midget just cast a spell to put a festering boil on your ass."
XI9NAV01 "A bit of healing potion should take care of it, but it will take a few weeks."
XI9NAV02 "Have a nice day."
XI10BAY00 "You run the prison here?"
XI10GOW00 "Yes sir."
XI10BAY01 "Have you managed to capture any of the cult members?"
XI10GOW01 "Not a one. If they are threatened with capture, they kill themselves."
XI10BAY02 "Hmmm.. interesting."
XI11GOW00 "Hello gorgeous. I'd lock you up anytime."
XI11MOR00 "Is that so?"
XI11GOW01 "Perhaps you'd like to come back later on? By yourself? I have something I'd like to show you."
XI11MOR01 "If I come back here by myself I'm leaving with your blood on my hands."
XI11GOW02 "Ahhh.. how 'bout we just forget the whole thing."
XI11MOR02 "I thought so."
XI12NAV00 "I abhor prisons."
XI12GOW00 "Spent some time in one?"
XI12NAV01 "Ha! I lift my leg on you worm! A sorcerer with my power could never be contained in a cell."
XI12GOW01 "You must show me your escape magic."
XI12GOW02 "Allow me to lock you in a cell."
XI12NAV02 "Uh.. We are very busy with a crucial quest right now."
XI12GOW03 "Aww c'mon it would only take a minute."
XI12NAV03 "I have no time for this foolishness!"
XI12GOW04 "Hmmph.. some sorcerer."
XI12NAV04 "What?"
XI12GOW05 "Nothing."
XI13BAY00 "A true warrior does not fear death, he welcomes it."
XI13RAN00 "Easy for you to say, you're not the one sentenced to die."
XI13BAY01 "There has been a contract out on my head for as long as I can remember."
XI13BAY02 "I know what it is to look death in the face."
XI13RAN01 "You want to take my place in here then?"
XI13BAY03 "Be strong soldier. We all must face death eventually."
XI14RAN00 "They really listened to my last requests!"
XI14RAN01 "They've sent me a woman!"
XI14MOR00 "Unless you want me to perform the execution myself, I'm not the kind of woman you requested."
XI14RAN02 "Would you refuse the last request of a man sentenced to death?"
XI14MOR01 "Sorry, I'm not much for charity work."
XI15NAV00 "So you're the guard that is to be executed?"
XI15RAN00 "Please, can you help? Can you get me out of here?"
XI15NAV01 "Get you out?"
XI15NAV02 "You must be kidding."
XI15NAV03 "Nothing beats a good execution for sheer entertainment value."
XII1GER00 "The mighty general Bayne 'Ironhand' VanGellan."
XII1GER01 "This sir, is truly an honor."
XII1BAY00 "You humble me sir."
XII1GER02 "Your actions in the Rugaardic wars are the stuff of legends."
XII1BAY01 "Some would questions my decisions at Lamark."
XII1GER03 "I have studied the matter extensively."
XII1GER04 "History will remember Bayne VanGellan as a mighty warrior and general."
XII1GER05 "Not the traitor some would make you out to be."
XII1BAY02 "I thank you for your support."
XII2GER00 "You bear the markings of one trained by the Rashamanth."
XII2MOR00 "I prefer to keep my past to myself."
XII2MOR01 "I suggest you do the same."
XII2GER01 "My apologies. The last thing I want is to anger an assassin."
XII2MOR02 "A wise decision. Your apology is accepted."
XII3GER00 "Welcome sorcerer."
XII3NAV00 "Greetings librarian."
XII3GER01 "I have some books on the magic arts if you are interested."
XII3NAV01 "The only books on magic that are of any importance are the ones that I wrote."
XII3GER02 "That's funny, you're name is unfamiliar to me."
XII3GER03 "Tell me, what have you written?"
XII3NAV02 "I.. I don't have the time for such idle chit-chat."
XII3NAV03 "Good day sir."
XII4BAY00 "You must be the combat master."
XII4JON00 "Indeed I am."
XII4BAY01 "I hear you have knowledge of advanced combat skills?"
XII4JON01 "I do."
XII4BAY02 "Will you train me?"
XII4JON02 "Your quest is a noble one."
XII4JON03 "It would be an honor to train you. Here is how it works."
XII4JON04 "I will give you a certain number of combat maneuvers you must learn."
XII4JON05 "You can practice them on that dummy over there until you feel you have mastered them."
XII4JON06 "Once you feel comfortable with the basics you can head into the field to test your skills. " 
XII4JON07 "The more field combat you get, the more powerful your attacks will become."
XII4JON08 "Return here often, I will teach you new attack moves if I feel you are ready to handle them."
XII4JON09 "The more creatures you kill, the more moves you can learn. Is all this clear?"
XII4BAY03 "Yes."
XII4JON11 "Good work Bayne."
XII4JON12 "Come back and check in with me every once in awhile."
XII4BAY04 "Thank you Jong. I'll return when I've increased my skills."
XII5JON00 "Welcome assassin."
XII5MOR00 "You train in advanced combat skills?"
XII5JON01 "I do."
XII5MOR01 "Will you train me?"
XII5JON02 "You show promise."
XII5JON03 "It would be an honor to train you. Here is how it works."
XII5JON04 "I will give you a certain number of combat maneuvers you must learn."
XII5JON05 "You can practice them on that dummy over there until you feel you have mastered them."
XII5JON06 "Once you feel comfortable with the basics you can head into the field to test your skills."
XII5JON07 "The more field combat you get, the more powerful your attacks will become."
XII5JON08 "Return here often, I will teach you new attack moves if I feel you are ready to handle them."
XII5JON09 "The more creatures you kill, the more moves you can learn. Is all this clear?"
XII5MOR02 "Yes."
XII5JON10 "I will now teach you a new attack. Pay close attention to my commands."
XII5JON11 "Good work Morganna."
XII5JON12 "Come back and check in with me every once in awhile."
XII5MOR03 "I will."
XII6NAV00 "So you are the combat master."
XII6NAV01 "I hear you have knowledge of advanced combat skills?"
XII6JON00 "That is correct."
XII6NAV02 "I admit my magic is more powerful than my weapon combat."
XII6NAV03 "Could you teach me?"
XII6JON01 "Even a powerful wizard must be able to defend themselves in combat. Here is the training procedure."
XII6JON02 "I will give you a certain number of combat maneuvers you must learn."
XII6JON03 "You can practice them on that dummy over there until you feel you have mastered them."
XII6JON04 "Once you feel comfortable with the basics you can head into the field to test your skills."
XII6JON05 "The more field combat you get, the more powerful your attacks will become."
XII6JON06 "Return here often, I will teach you new attack moves if I feel you are ready to handle them."
XII6JON07 "The more creatures you kill, the more moves you can learn. Is all this clear?"
XII6NAV04 "Yes."
XII6JON09 "Good work Navarro."
XII6JON10 "Come back and check in with me every once in awhile."
XII6NAV05 "I'll do that. Thanks."
XII7GUS00 "So, how goes your quest?"
XII7BAY00 "I fear the task before us will be difficult."
XII7GUS01 "I know I wouldn't want to be in your shoes."
XII7BAY01 "Few men exhibit the courage and bravery necessary for such a task."
XII7GUS02 "Whatever friend, I'd just as soon not get butchered by an army of evil priests."
XII8GUS00 "Why is it that you don't smile?"
XII8MOR00 "I have no reason to smile."
XII8GUS01 "There must be something that makes you happy?"
XII8MOR01 "Let's see.."
XII8MOR02 "Looking into the eyes of a man dying by my hand."
XII8MOR03 "I think that makes me smile."
XII8GUS02 "Hmm.. Uh.. I think you have some serious issues."
XII9GUS00 "So you're the mage of the group?"
XII9NAV00 "I am."
XII9GUS01 "Could you teach me some spells?"
XII9NAV01 "Like what?"
XII9GUS02 "How about a spell that tricks woman into falling desperately in love with you."
XII9NAV02 "You're not serious."
XII9GUS03 "Are you telling me you've never thought about wanting a spell like that?"
XII9NAV03 "Of course not.. well, maybe but I.. oh forget it."
XII10BAY00 "A pint of your finest ale sir !!"
XII10RUB00 "I'll not serve the likes of you."
XII10BAY01 "Excuse me?"
XII10RUB01 "My brother died in the battle of Lamark as a result of you're cowardice."
XII10BAY02 "I am sorry about your brother, but I stand by the decisions I made."
XII10RUB02 "The sooner you leave this establishment the better."
XII10BAY03 "As you wish."
XII10BAY04 "We'll take care of our business and I'll be on my way."
XII11RUB00 "And who have we here?"
XII11MOR00 "4 shots tequilla."
XII11RUB01 "Right away?"
XII11MOR01 "Make them doubles."
XII11RUB02 "Lemon and salt?"
XII11MOR02 "Straight."
XII11RUB03 "As you wish."
XII12RUB00 "Welcome to the Drunken Whore."
XII12RUB01 "What can I get for you?"
XII12NAV00 "I'd like a white wine spritzer with a twist of lime and a mint leaf please."
XII12RUB02 "Uhh.. listen pal, we don't exactly serve that here."
XII12NAV01 "A pity.. How about a perrier with a splash of crme de menthe?"
XII12RUB03 "I don't think you understand."
XII12RUB04 "We sell four things here."
XII12RUB05 "Ale, Liquor, Food, and ass kickings to anyone who orders anything with a 'twist' or a 'splash'."
XII12NAV02 "I see."
XII13KYL00 "Oooohh! I like my men big and strong!"
XII13BAY00 "Aye, but I like my women without facial hair."
XII13KYL01 "Excuse me?"
XII13BAY01 "No, excuse me. Your breath is enough to intoxicate an Ogrok."
XII14KYL00 "Don't think about moving in on my territory sweetheart."
XII14MOR00 "I wouldn't dream of it."
XII14KYL01 "I'm famous around here y'know."
XII14KYL02 "Rubold even named the bar after me."
XII14MOR01 "The Drunken Whore. You must be very proud."
XII14KYL03 "Hey, you want to get up here and try dancing for the men?"
XII14MOR02 "I don't think so. I find everything you represent rather revolting."
XII14KYL04 "I understand sweetie. We all get that way sometimes."
XII14MOR03 "Some of us more than others I'm sure."
XII14MOR04 "See ya."
XII15NAV00 "Greetings miss."
XII15NAV01 "You're dancing is as lovely as you are."
XII15KYL00 "Bug off you old fart."
XII15KYL01 "Your crowding my action."
XII15NAV02 "Well, I never!"

XII22GIN01 "My handcrafted weaponry is the finest on all of Ur."
XII22GIN02 "Let's see, you look like an Axe and Maul man."
XII22BAY00 "How did you guess?"
XII22BAY01 "Show me what you have available."
XII22GIN03 "My prices are non-negotiable.. and you don't have enough gold."

XII22GIN05 "Is that all you'll be needing?"
XII22BAY02 "Yes, that'll do it."

XII23GIN00 "A fellow sister of the blade?"
XII23GIN01 "It is good to meet you."
XII23GIN01 "If have a feeling you'll be needing some assassin type weaponry."
XII23MOR00 "Your blades are exceptional."
XII23MOR01 "Show me what you have available."
XII23GIN02 "Is that all you'll be needing?"
XII23MOR02 "For now, yes."
XII23MOR03 "May I see your wares once again?."

XII23GIN04 "I have a few things in the works you may be interested in so check back in with me later."
XII23GIN05 "Good luck to you out there."

XII25CAM01 "Our survival depends on you now."
XII25BAY00 "Your days of living in fear will soon be over."
XII25BAY01 "We will conquer the cult or die trying."
XII25VER00 "The mighty Ironhand in Misthaven."
XII25VER01 "Will wonders never cease."
XII25VER02 "I must say it is a pleasure to meet you sir."
XII25BAY02 "I thank you for your kind words."
XII25LUC00 "So you're here to save Misthaven."
XII25LUC01 "It's always good to have someone who knows how to crack a few skulls on your side."
XII25BAY03 "I'll make sure and notch a few kills for you."
XII25PAU00 "You fight for Misthaven."
XII25PAU01 "We must all pray for your safety."
XII25MAU00 "Welcome to Misthaven."
XII25MAU01 "You should come back here every once in awhile and check in with the shops."
XII25MAU02 "We get new shipments every once in awhile."
XII25HEA00 "The gods deem the souls of our champions to be unfit!"
XII25HEA01 "You must be cleansed!"
XII25BAY04 "I think we should be going now."
XII26CAM00 "A woman who carries a blade?"
XII26CAM01 "What manner of madness is this?"
XII26MOR00 "You have a problem with me carrying a weapon?"
XII26CAM02 "I.. uh..of course not."
XII26CAM03 "I have no problem with that."
XII26MOR01 "You had best make sure that you don't."
XII26VER00 "To what do we owe the honor of your presence Miss?"
XII26MOR02 "I heard Misthaven was fighting with the cult."
XII26MOR03 "Where there is battle, I follow."
XII26VER01 "A dangerous trade for a woman wouldn't you say?"
XII26MOR04 "Maybe a woman who wasn't trained to kill a man 300 different ways."
XII26VER02 "Ahh.. I see."
XII26LUC00 "Wow. A real assassin in Misthaven huh."
XII26LUC01 "I must admit I've never met one of your kind before."
XII26MOR05 "Most who meet my kind don't live long enough to tell about it."
XII26LUC02 "I see. Well I'll just be shuffling along now here don't ya see."
XII26PAU00 "A woman who has lost her way."
XII26PAU01 "The Gods forbid women to carry weapons."
XII26MOR06 "The Gods can kiss my a##."
XII26PAU02 "Blasphemer!!!! How dare you speak those words!"
XII26MAU00 "Greetings Morganna."
XII26MAU01 "It does my heart good to see a woman wield a weapon as good as any man."
XII26MOR07 "I've yet to meet a man who can match me in combat."
XII26MAU02 "Your confidence is nothing short of inspiring."
XII26HEA00 "So you're the female assassin."
XII26MOR08 "That's right."
XII26HEA01 "The Gods sa.."
XII26MOR09 "You say one more word about your so called Gods and I'll cut your tongue from your mouth."
XII26MOR10 "Is that clear?"
XII26HEA02 "Mmm Hmm."
XII26MOR11 "Good."
XII27CAM00 "Hope you have your ressurection spell ready."
XII27CAM01 "You guys don't stand much of a chance out there."
XII27NAV00 "Is that right."
XII27NAV01 "I take it you've never seen what happens when a fire cone spell hits a human being?"
XII27CAM02 "Uhh.. no, I guess I haven't."
XII27NAV02 "Great. Stand right here and let me show you first hand."
XII27CAM03 "Whoa! That's O.K., I'll take your word on it."
XII27VER00 "It is rare to see a mage around these parts."
XII27NAV03 "Indeed, you peasants are all very lucky to be graced by my presence."
XII27VER01 "I see you are the humble type."
XII27NAV04 "Humility is for common folk."
XII27VER02 "If you say so pal."
XII27VER03 "Wish I could say it was nice talking to you."
XII27LUC00 "Hey, you're a wizard baby!"
XII27NAV05 "Stunning powers of observation."
XII27LUC01 "There's a ton of powerful talismans around the island."
XII27NAV06 "Is that so. Tell me where."
XII27LUC02 "Oh, I haven't got the slightest idea honey."
XII27NAV07 "What!"
XII27LUC03 "I just know that where there is magic there are talismans."
XII27LUC04 "And the priests use magic like crazy."
XII27NAV08 "So you're saying the priests have the talismans?"
XII27LUC05 "How the hell would I know."
XII27LUC06 "I'm not about to go frisking a member of the cult for talismans."
XII27LUC07 "I mean, what would people think if they saw me patting down some other guy?"
XII27NAV09 "That's why you kill them first."
XII27LUC08 "Hey pal, I don't what kind of freak you are but I'm not about to go frisking any dead people."
XII27LUC09 "No I.. The.. Oh, Never mind."
XII27PAU00 "The magic arts are best left to the Gods you know."
XII27NAV10 "The Gods help those who help themselves."
XII27PAU01 "That philosophy won't get you very far."
XII27NAV11 "Oh no? Just look at me."
XII27PAU02 "I'd rather not, I just ate."
XII27MAU00 "You'll be needing talismans I'm sure."
XII27NAV12 "Do you know where some may be located?"
XII27MAU01 "If I were you I'd search the bodies of the priests."
XII27MAU02 "Some of them are bound to carry magical items and talismans."
XII27NAV13 "I thank you for your help M'aam."
XII27HEA00 "One who worships the dark arts enters my home!"
XII27HEA01 "My home will be forever cursed by your presence! Please go!"
XII27HEA02 "Now I must wash every inch of this house with a fine brush. It will take weeks!"
XII27NAV14 "Excellent. Our trip here was not wasted then."
XIII1BAY00 "I am Bayne."
XIII1HAR00 "Hello Bayne, I am Harowen."
XIII1HAR01 "Welcome to my tower, sit down and stay awhile."
XIII1BAY01 "Thank you for the offer but I am here on a business."
XIII1BAY02 "I'm not sure I trust you enough to relax."
XIII1HAR02 "Awww.. c'mon."
XIII1HAR03 "All work and no play makes Bayne a dull boy."
XIII1BAY03 "Women like you are dangerous."
XIII1HAR04 "Are you scared of little old me?"
XIII1BAY04 "I'd rather face a pack of Issathi than a beautiful temptress any day."
XIII1HAR05 "Ahh well, you're loss."
XIII2HAR00 "You... You're one of us!"
XIII2MOR00 "Don't flatter yourself sweetheart."
XIII2MOR01 "One of who?"
XIII2HAR01 "But you must be a thief or an assassin."
XIII2HAR02 "I can tell from your markings."
XIII2HAR03 "You're one of us!"
XIII2HAR04 "The thieves guild of course!"
XIII2MOR02 "Thieves guild?"
XIII2MOR03 "A true thief trusts no one, especially not other thieves."
XIII2MOR04 "So you can take your guild and sh.."
XIII2HAR05 "O.K, O.K, I see your point."
XIII3HAR00 "A visit from a wizard, how rare!"
XIII3NAV00 "Indeed it is."
XIII3HAR01 "Perhaps you will teach me some spells?"
XIII3NAV01 "I'm not sure that's such a good idea."
XIII3NAV02 "What's in it for me?"
XIII3HAR02 "Aww.. c'mon sweetie.. please?"
XIII3HAR03 "Anything you want."
XIII3NAV03 "Really? Anything?"
XIII3HAR04 "Yes real.. hey wait a minute."
XIII3NAV04 "What?"
XIII3HAR05 "Even I won't sink that low."
XIII3NAV05 "That's all right, I wasn't going to teach you anyway."
XIII4BAY00 "So this is the Ogrok village."
XIII4GAT00 "That's right! and we don't appreciate humans nosing around here."
XIII4BAY01 "I see."
XIII4GAT01 "Stay out of trouble and I won't have to hurt you."
XIII5GAT00 "Human female thinks she is a fighter?"
XIII5GAT01 "Be careful you don't get your pretty face smashed up around here."
XIII5MOR00 "Typical Ogrok. " 
XIII5MOR01 "Big weapons, big threats, but tiny where it counts the most."
XIII6GAT00 "You look more like a dwarf than a human."
XIII6GAT01 "Ogrok's like to eat dwarves you know."
XIII6NAV00 "Yes and wizards like to blast Ogroks with fireballs."
XIII6GAT02 "You're a wizard?"
XIII6NAV01 "Indeed I am."
XIII6GAT03 "No your not."
XIII6NAV02 "You doubt me?  How dare you insult an Al Xace that way."
XIII6GAT04 "Sure.. now get lost, pip-squeak."
XIII6NAV03 "You will feel my wrath."
XIII6GAT05 "I'm warning you, If you don't leave now I'll have to hurt you."
XIII6NAV04 "Uhh.. that's okay.  I'll be going."
XIII7CHI00 "You have the look of a battle hardened warrior. " 
XIII7CHI01 "The Ogrok value the glory of combat above all else."
XIII7BAY00 "Indeed the deeds of the Ogrok in battle are legendary."
XIII7CHI02 "I like this human.. we shall make him an honorary member of our clan."
XIII7BAY01 "It would be a great honor."
XIII7BAY02 "I thank you chief."
XIII8CHI00 "Female human warrior."
XIII8CHI01 "This one has the eyes of a killer."
XIII8CHI02 "Tell me your name."
XIII8MOR00 "I am Morganna."
XIII8CHI03 "You are pleasant to look at Morganna."
XIII8CHI04 "Perhps I will take you as a mate."
XIII8MOR01 "I don't mate with Ogrok, I kill them."
XIII8CHI05 "A woman with spirit!"
XIII8CHI06 "I like this human! Ahh.. you would make an excellent wife."
XIII8MOR02 "I'm thrilled, but no thanks."
XIII9NAV00 "Greetings Chief."
XIII9NAV01 "Acting as emissary and diplomat I would like to.."
XIII9CHI00 "Silence!"
XIII9NAV02 "Uhhh I don't think you understand.  My name is Nav.."
XIII9CHI01 "The Ogrok hate magic users above all else."
XIII9CHI02 "We will roast this one over the fire!"
XIII9NAV03 "Now wait a minute I.."
XIII9CHI03 "I joke with wizard."
XIII9CHI04 "Not enough meat on your bones for feast."
XIII9NAV04 "Thank the gods!"
XIII9NAV05 "You've made a wise decision chief I.."
XIII9CHI05 "I could change my mind if you don't shut up!"
XIII9NAV06 "Right. Nice talking to you."
XIII10OLI00 "Listen to my words mighty one."
XIII10OLI01 "More important than destroying the cult."
XIII10OLI02 "More important than rescuing Andria."
XIII10OLI03 "You must protect Locke from harm."
XIII10BAY00 "Locke can take care of himself."
XIII10BAY01 "What's so important about Locke?"
XIII10OLI04 "True, but if something should happen to him.. all is lost."
XIII10BAY02 "I trust your wisdom old man."
XIII10BAY03 "I will heed your words."
XIII10OLI05 "Locke's purpose here goes far beyond what you could possibly imagine."
XIII10OLI06 "He must be protected at all costs."
XIII11OLI00 "What have we here?"
XIII11OLI01 "An assassin has been recruited for this quest?"
XIII11MOR00 "You have a problem with that?"
XIII11OLI02 "Can you fight?"
XIII11MOR01 "You want to try me?"
XIII11MOR02 "The last person to question my combat skill died painfully."
XIII11OLI03 "You certainly sound like you can fight."
XIII11OLI04 "But you will need all your skill and training to survive this quest."
XIII11OLI05 "Ahh.. no."
XIII11OLI06 "You seem a capable warrior."
XIII11OLI07 "Your damn right I am."
XIII12OLI00 "So you're the wizard of the group?"
XIII12OLI01 "I hope you are prepared."
XIII12NAV00 "Of course, I am always prepared."
XIII12OLI02 "Powerful magic the priests possess."
XIII12NAV01 "I've yet to meet my equal in the ways of magic."
XIII12OLI03 "Then you clearly have not met many members of the cult."
XIV1SAB00 "Abandon your quest and submit to the cult!"
XIV1BAY00 "I'll die before I submit to your twisted cult."
XIV1SAB01 "You're going to die regardless."
XIV1SAB02 "Submit and you'll be spared a painful death."
XIV1BAY01 "Pain means nothing to me."
XIV1SAB03 "Oh but it will, believe me, it will."
XIV2SAB00 "They send a woman out to battle us?"
XIV2SAB01 "This must be Misthaven's idea of a joke."
XIV2MOR00 "How funny will it be when I cut your throat out?"
XIV2SAB02 "You dare threaten me?"
XIV2SAB03 "I'll see to it that every member of the cult is given the task of bringing me your head."
XIV2MOR01 "And I'll see to it that every one of them dies trying."
XIV3SAB00 "What manner of man is this?"
XIV3NAV00 "I am the all powerful Navarro De Vray Al Xace."
XIV3SAB01 "Al Xace?"
XIV3SAB02 "It takes more than tacking a title onto your name to impress me."
XIV3SAB03 "Your magic power is disgraceful."
XIV3SAB04 "You are an insignificant fool."
XIV3SAB05 "Now remove yourself from my sight before I squash you under my foot."
XIV4CHI00 "Greetings warrior."
XIV4CHI01 "Would you like to try some Druhg soup?"
XIV4BAY00 "Druhg soup?"
XIV4CHI02 "Made from only the finest Druhg slaves."
XIV4BAY01 "Uh.. not for me thanks."
XIV5CHI00 "Can I get you some Druhg soup?"
XIV5MOR00 "I'm not interested."
XIV6NAV00 "What did you say you were making here?"
XIV6CHI00 "Druhg soup!"
XIV6CHI01 "The priests love it."
XIV6NAV01 "You people eat the Druhg?"
XIV6CHI02 "Of course we eat Druhg."
XIV6CHI03 "With a little garlic and tabasco they're quite delicious."
XIV6NAV02 "Ugghh! I'm not feeling so good."
XIV7TOR00 "You look like a strong one."
XIV7TOR01 "We could use you in here."
XIV7TOR02 "You know how to swing a whip?"
XIV7BAY00 "There is no honor in torture."
XIV7BAY01 "This place reeks of death."
XIV7TOR03 "You get used to the smell after awhile."
XIV7TOR04 "But the screams of pain never get old."
XIV8TOR00 "I haven't seen a female in many years."
XIV8MOR00 "Don't get any ideas."
XIV8MOR01 "You don't even give your victims a chance to fight back in here."
XIV8MOR02 "Where's the fun in that?"
XIV8TOR01 "I don't think they had the word fun in mind when they built this room."
XIV8TOR02 "That's why they call it the chamber of horrors."
XIV9NAV00 "So this is where you torture people?"
XIV9TOR00 "Not just people."
XIV9TOR01 "We torture Druhg and other creatures here as well."
XIV9NAV01 "Now what sort of torture methods do you use here?"
XIV9NAV02 "This is sick and twisted."
XIV9TOR02 "We have the stretching rack, iron maidens, whipping posts, and starvation cells. " 
XIV9TOR03 "And that's just to name a few."
XIV9NAV03 "That's quite a selection."
XIV9TOR04 "We're quite proud of it ourselves."
XIV9TOR05 "Hey, it's not for everybody."
XIV9TOR06 "You have to have a pretty strong stomach for this kind of work."
XIV10BAY00 "Tell me of these dungeons priest."
XIV10WAN00 "There are miles and miles of passages throughout these dungeons."
XIV10WAN01 "I have heard rumors of massive mazes, giant underground lakes, even a pyramid with hanging gardens."
XIV10BAY01 "Amazing."
XIV10WAN02 "the ancients built it all."
XIV10WAN03 "When the cult moved in here it was all abandoned and waiting for them."
XIV10WAN04 "However, in all the time that they've been here, they have not yet found the Nahkranoth lair they so desperately seek." 
XIV11MOR00 "Give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you where you stand."
XIV11WAN00 "I..I'm on your side!!"
XIV11MOR01 "We've killed every other priest we found."
XIV11MOR02 "What makes you so different."
XIV11WAN01 "I too fight the priests."
XIV11WAN02 "I work here as an undercover spy."
XIV11MOR03 "I think you're just trying to save yourself."
XIV11MOR04 "I do not trust anything that wears the robes of the cult."
XIV12NAV00 "What can you tell me about the magic capabilities of these priests?"
XIV12WAN00 "They are fairly powerful, but nothing you shouldn't be able to handle."
XIV12WAN01 "The two men who run the cult operations down here are the ones you need to fear the most."
XIV12NAV01 "And who might that be?"
XIV12WAN02 "Jhaga and Sabu."
XIV12WAN03 "They have magic the likes of which I have never seen before."
XIV12NAV02 "Thank you for the information."
XIV12WAN04 "If it helps bring the cult down, I'll do whatever I can."
XIV13DRU00 "Druhg not talk to human."
XIV13DRU01 "Druhg get sent to chamber of horrors if caught talking."
XIV13DRU02 "Human leave Druhg alone."
XIV14DRU00 "Human cannot help Druhg."
XIV14DRU01 "Druhg under priests control now."
XIV14DRU02 "Better to leave Druhg alone."
XIV15DRU00 "Small man same size as Druhg."
XIV15DRU01 "Small man leave Druhg alone."
XIV15DRU02 "Druhg get back to work before guards come."
XIV16BAY00 "You managed to escape the slave camps?"
XIV16SHE00 "Shegra smarter then average Druhg."
XIV16SHE01 "Found secret tunnel and escaped."
XIV16BAY01 "We'll get the rest of your people out of there."
XIV16SHE02 "Shegra be very thankful to humans for their help."
XIV17SHE00 "Female human try and steal Shegra's man?"
XIV17MOR00 "I wouldn't dream of it."
XIV17SHE01 "Locke human belong to Shegra?"
XIV17MOR01 "He's all yours."
XIV18NAV00 "Perhaps I can help free your friends?"
XIV18SHE00 "No spell can free Druhg."
XIV18SHE01 "Only way to stop spell is to kill human who cast it. " 
XIV18NAV01 "Let me guess.. Sabu."
XIV18SHE02 "Sabu must die to free druhg."
XIV19JHA00 "And who might you be?"
XIV19BAY00 "I am Bayne VanGellan."
XIV19BAY01 "The man that ends your existence."
XIV19JHA01 "The infamous Rugaardic general who turned on his own troops in battle?"
XIV19JHA02 "Is this the best help you could find?"
XIV19JHA03 "Destroying you holds no challenge for me."
XIV19BAY02 "Prepare yourself Jhaga."
XIV19BAY03 "Your reign of evil ends right here."
XIV19JHA04 "Your threats are amusing."
XIV19JHA05 "But who are you really?"
XIV20MOR00 "You are the man responsible for the cult?"
XIV20JHA00 "I am."
XIV20MOR01 "Good."
XIV20MOR02 "Now I have a reason to kill you."
XIV21JHA00 "What kind of poor excuse for a man are you?"
XIV21NAV00 "I am the most powerful sorcerer on all of Ur."
XIV21NAV01 "Navarro De..."
XIV21JHA01 "Please spare me."
XIV21JHA02 "allow me to show you what true power really is."
